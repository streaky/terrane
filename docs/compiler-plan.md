# Terrane first-version compiler plan

## 1. Purpose

Build the first usable Terrane compiler as a source-to-Rust toolchain. The compiler must accept a deliberately bounded, coherent subset of Terrane, produce readable and deterministic Rust, invoke Cargo/rustc, and return diagnostics in Terrane source terms.

This plan is for an executable compiler, not another language-design prototype. Every milestone must finish with source programs that are compiled and run through the real pipeline.

`demos/` is explicitly outside the compiler conformance contract. Files there are exploratory pressure tests and may intentionally combine unfinished syntax, package adapters, kernel facilities, unsafe contracts, or speculative semantics. They must not be used as smoke tests, parser fixtures, acceptance criteria, or examples of what the current compiler is expected to build. Compiler development will create purpose-built test programs under `tests/` and runnable examples under `examples/` instead.

## 2. First-version outcome

The first version is complete when a user can:

```text
terrane check path/to/program.trn
terrane run path/to/program.trn -- program-arguments
terrane build path/to/program.trn
terrane rust path/to/program.trn
```

and the toolchain can compile and run a small but nontrivial command-line program using:

- a namespace declaration;
- namespace-local bindings and functions;
- core scalar values;
- quoted, tail, and indented block strings;
- arithmetic, comparisons, and Boolean conditions;
- explicit semicolon calls, member invocation, and dot-objects passed as ordinary argument values;
- positional and named arguments, including optional parameters;
- `if`/`else`, `while`, collection and three-clause `for`, and `return`;
- the exact version-one default prelude and standard output facility;
- deterministic generated Rust and a Cargo project;
- source-oriented lexer, parser, resolver, type, and backend diagnostics.

That list is the **first runnable outcome**, reached at milestone 6, not the boundary of version one. Version one as now specified also requires structured errors, the callable-family and descriptor models, collections and iteration, classes and interfaces, ownership and resources, callable contracts and reflection, async with structured concurrency, and the standard facilities in milestones 20 through 26. Milestones 7 onward deliver those.

Version one still does not need universal dynamic values, source-declared generics, general pattern matching, multiple class inheritance, generators, labels and `goto`, hot-code replacement, `no_std`, embedded targets, or kernel targets. Syntax for deferred features may be recognized only when doing so enables a precise “not supported in this compiler version” diagnostic; it must never be accepted and lowered incorrectly.

## 3. Delivery principles

1. **Tests define implemented behavior.** The design draft informs the implementation, but an executable conformance case is required before a feature is considered supported.
2. **No dependency on `demos/`.** CI must neither compile nor parse files from `demos/` unless a future, explicitly named demo-specific job is introduced.
3. **Vertical slices before breadth.** Establish `source -> Rust -> Cargo -> executable` early, then expand the language through end-to-end slices.
4. **One semantic path.** `check`, `run`, `build`, and `rust` share the same frontend and semantic pipeline. Commands must not grow separate parsers or validators.
5. **No silent repair.** Invalid Terrane is rejected at its source span. The compiler must not reinterpret failed syntax as a nearby construct merely to continue.
6. **Deterministic output.** The same source, compiler version, target, and declared inputs produce byte-identical generated source and manifests.
7. **Readable lowering.** Generated Rust is a public debugging surface, not opaque compiler debris.
8. **Narrow runtime.** Statically known fixed-width scalars and functions lower directly to Rust types and calls where Rust preserves the complete Terrane contract; core `int` uses the narrowest exact representation required by its adaptive semantics. The first compiler must not introduce a universal boxed `Value` as a shortcut.
9. **Standard facilities are written in Terrane.** The Rust core stays deliberately minimal. Document formats, networking protocols, compression framing, date and time arithmetic, paths, CLI parsing, and logging are Terrane packages over that core, not Rust support crates. A Rust support crate is permanently opaque to the compiler, so implementing a facility in Rust forecloses inlining, specialisation, and whole-program analysis for it forever; it also loses the readable Terrane frames the diagnostics contract requires. The boundary runs per layer rather than per facility: Rust owns the layer that is a syscall or ABI boundary, carries a guarantee the optimiser would destroy, is a large audited security-critical implementation, or is generated data — and a layer claiming to be Rust states which of the four applies. Everything above it is Terrane. Core libraries reach Rust through the ordinary dependency mechanism, so they carry no privileged path and double as worked examples. Two consequences are load-bearing rather than incidental: package-level artifact caching, because a source-form standard library would otherwise be recompiled by every build, and capability profiles expressed as which packages are present rather than which crates were compiled in.

## 4. Proposed repository layout

```text

  Cargo.toml
  crates/

      Cargo.toml
      src/
        main.rs

          run/
        fixtures/

  hello.trn
  word-count.trn
  build-report.trn
```

The first compiler and its CLI should be implemented in Rust. This gives the project one distributable executable, exhaustive phase models, direct integration with Cargo diagnostics and any support crates, and no later frontend rewrite boundary.

Use mature Rust parsing tooling rather than treating Rust as a requirement to hand-write every frontend component. Chumsky is a strong initial candidate: it supports separate character and token parsers, token-associated spans, recursive combinators, Pratt expression parsing, rich errors, and recovery. Prototype Terrane's hardest lexical and grammatical boundaries with it before freezing the parser architecture. Keep Terrane tokens, syntax nodes, spans, and diagnostics compiler-owned so replacing or selectively bypassing the parsing library would not change the language model.

Do not create a general runtime crate before an implemented feature requires one. Core `int` is the first such feature: introduce a small support crate with its first semantic/lowering slice for adaptive exact integers and their normative failures. Keep other statically known values on direct Rust lowering and add support only for behavior that generated code cannot express cleanly.

## 5. Test corpus design

### 5.1 Fixture contract

Each conformance case is a directory or manifest entry containing only the artifacts relevant to its assertion:

```terrane
case.trn     # single-source input
package.toml    # optional package manifest for multi-source cases
case.toml       # phase, expected status, entrypoint, arguments, canonical-Rust expectation
stdin.txt       # optional exact input
stdout.txt      # optional exact output
stderr.txt      # optional exact diagnostic or uncaught source-runtime error
exit-code.txt   # optional exact exit code; defaults to zero for accepted runs
parse.json      # optional normalized syntax shape
resolve.json    # optional symbol-resolution facts
lower.rs        # optional canonical generated Rust
```

`package.toml` is the authored package contract exercised by milestone 3; `case.toml` remains
test-harness metadata and points to it when present. An accepted case may set
`canonical-rust = true` once its untouched lowering is known to match the bundled formatter; the
conformance runner then compiles that case with canonical validation enabled so later formatting
regressions fail at their source. Absence means no canonical-format claim, not that noncanonical
output is expected. Runtime-failure fixtures must provide both `stderr.txt` and `exit-code.txt`.

Golden files must be reviewed output, not snapshots accepted blindly. Unstable data such as temporary paths is normalized by the test harness before comparison.

### 5.2 Test layers

- **Lexer unit tests:** tokens, trivia, indentation transitions, spans, UTF-8 boundaries, comments, strings, identifier/operator attachment, and malformed input.
- **Parser conformance tests:** accepted and rejected syntax plus compact normalized trees.
- **Resolver tests:** namespace paths, root/parent anchors, ordinary versus object-form lookup, scopes, duplicate names, and unresolved names.
- **Semantic tests:** type compatibility, call binding, control-flow validity, definite return, and unsupported-feature diagnostics.
- **Lowering goldens:** readable Rust for small constructs, including exact source identity comments or map entries where applicable.
- **Corpus scale:** expect hundreds or thousands of minimal snippets, each isolating one lowering decision and comparing canonical Rust byte for byte.
- **Compile tests:** batch independent accepted snippets into deterministic generated crates for `cargo check`; compile cases individually when crate structure, linking, or diagnostics are part of the contract.
- **Run tests:** purpose-built Terrane programs execute and produce exact output and exit status.
- **CLI integration tests:** command arguments, exit codes, output locations, and diagnostic behavior.
- **Differential invariants:** `check` and `build` accept or reject the same source; `rust` uses the same semantic model; formatting or comments do not alter runtime behavior.

### 5.3 Initial real programs

Create these incrementally rather than borrowing from `demos/`:

1. **hello:** import/bind output, define `main`, print exact text.
2. **build-report:** kebab-case bindings, typed integers and strings, receiver-based string joining, named arguments, and output. Because fixed-width names are `/core/types` descriptor objects rather than prelude bindings, the authored file either uses `int` or writes the explicit descriptor import and ordinary binding for each width it names.
3. **fizz-buzz:** arithmetic, comparisons, `if`/`else`, a loop, function calls, and return.
4. **word-count:** command-line arguments, string iteration or splitting, a standard collection, mutation, and deterministic formatted output. Add only after milestone 4 selects and implements an explicit grapheme/scalar/byte iteration contract and a collection subset whose mutation preserves version-one value semantics.
5. **multi-file greeting:** two namespaces, explicit object import, ordinary binding, and deterministic module lowering.

Each program becomes a permanent end-to-end regression test. Examples should demonstrate only released behavior and must build in CI.

## 6. Architecture contracts to freeze early

### 6.1 Source and spans

- Assign every source file a stable file ID within a compilation.
- Store byte offsets as the canonical span representation and derive line/column lazily.
- Preserve trivia in the lossless syntax layer even if the semantic AST discards it.
- A diagnostic owns a primary span, message, stable diagnostic code, optional labels, notes, and help.

### 6.2 Syntax model

Use three layers:

1. immutable token stream with trivia and indentation tokens;
2. lossless concrete syntax tree for formatting/tooling;
3. compact semantic AST with source spans for resolution and lowering.

The parser must recover at statement and dedent boundaries so one error does not turn a file into noise, but recovered nodes may never reach lowering as valid constructs.

### 6.3 Names

- Preserve exact Terrane spelling as symbol identity.
- Maintain ordinary names and object-form names as distinct lookup views.
- Encode Rust identifiers with one deterministic, injective algorithm shared by declarations, references, source maps, and tests.
- Never normalize punctuation away: `foo+bar`, `foobar`, and `fooplusbar` remain distinct.

### 6.4 Semantic model

Every resolved expression records:

- source span and stable node ID;
- resolved symbol or builtin operation;
- static type or finite dynamic alternatives;
- value category needed by lowering;
- selected call target and argument binding;
- control-flow facts relevant to reachability and returns.

The first version may reject a dynamic construct whose finite representation cannot yet be proven. It must explain that limitation rather than emit a universal runtime representation silently.

### 6.5 Backend boundary

Lower the semantic model to a small Rust-oriented IR before rendering text. The IR should represent modules, items, blocks, expressions, types, calls, and source associations without containing formatting decisions. Rust emission then becomes deterministic pretty-printing rather than semantic analysis embedded in string concatenation.

## 7. Milestones

### Milestone 0 — Toolchain skeleton and executable corpus

Deliver:

- Rust workspace, `terrane` CLI executable, and compiler library;
- compiler version reporting and structured exit codes;
- isolated temporary/build directories;
- conformance harness supporting accept, reject, Rust golden, compile, and run cases;
- automatic Rust toolchain prerequisite check;
- initial `hello` accepted fixture and several rejected placeholders that fail with an explicit unsupported-stage diagnostic;
- CI commands that run compiler tests without traversing `demos/`.

End-to-end proof:

```text
terrane rust tests/conformance/run/hello/case.trn
terrane build tests/conformance/run/hello/case.trn
<generated executable>
```

At this milestone the frontend may support only the exact constructs needed by `hello`, but the source must travel through the real token, syntax, semantic, lowering, Cargo, and execution boundaries. Do not implement `hello` by source-text substitution.

Exit criterion: one purpose-built Terrane file produces a real executable and exact expected output; malformed input fails through the diagnostic framework.

Implementation note: milestone zero names the intended pipeline boundaries, but its bootstrap frontend is deliberately not yet structurally separated. Its `lex` stage records logical lines rather than tokens, import and binding forms are recognized as exact supported lines, unresolved-object detection remains parser-local, and the current resolve/lower boundaries mostly transfer fields. Milestone one therefore builds the real tokenizing lexer rather than extending a complete lexer, and later milestones make resolution and typed lowering substantive.

### Milestone 1 — Lexer and indentation correctness

Deliver:

- UTF-8 source validation with an explicitly versioned ASCII-only identifier character policy for the first compiler;
- tokens with exact spans and retained trivia;
- `NEWLINE`, `INDENT`, and `DEDENT` generation;
- blank lines and comment-only lines that do not perturb indentation;
- `#`, `//`, and `/* ... */` comments;
- quoted, tail, and indented block strings plus numeric literals;
- identifiers with operator-bearing joiners, including `<` and `>`, while a terminal joiner followed by a digits-only unit is rejected;
- comparison and shift operators using `<`, `>`, `<<`, and `>>`, with `>` and `>>` additionally opening tail and block strings in expression-start position; these tokens never delimit generic arguments;
- structural punctuation and spacing-sensitive operator attachment, including `++`/`--` as declared postfix tokens;
- lexical diagnostics for mixed tab/space indentation styles, invalid characters, unterminated strings/comments, inconsistent dedents, illegal attached operators, and attached joiner-plus-digits forms such as `count-1` with a spaced-expression fix.

Required conformance boundaries include:

```terrane
ipv4/ipv6
ipv4 / ipv6
a+b
a + b
a+ b
a +b
print.concat
print .concat
count-1
-einval
list<string>
list<string>= x
value===other
```

The lexer must tokenize `value === other` and `value===other` consistently as `==` followed by structural `=`, and must tokenize `list<string>` without treating angle brackets as generic delimiters. Both angle spellings must tokenize deterministically even though they produce different trailing tokens: a bare trailing `>` where whitespace or a delimiter follows, and a single `>=` token where `=` follows immediately. Milestone 2 owns the contextual rejection and fixes for every one of these spellings.

Indentation cases must cover consistently space-indented and consistently tab-indented files, a mixture within one indentation prefix, and a style change between different code lines in one file.

Exit criterion: lexer corpus covers every token class and malformed boundary; all diagnostics point to the originating bytes and remain correct for multibyte UTF-8.

Implementation status (completed on the `indentation-lexer` capability branch):

- the shared compiler pipeline uses compiler-owned tokens, trivia, byte spans, and lexical diagnostics before the bootstrap parser;
- the lexer emits structural newline and indentation transitions, retains whitespace and all three comment forms, and decides text markers, comparisons, and shifts from the preceding token rather than from line text;
- tokens, trivia, and indentation transitions cover every source byte exactly once: a block string token spans its marker and body, and one terminator ends the statement it completes;
- only lines carrying source outside comments participate in indentation, so blank lines, comment-only lines, and multiline comment terminators never open or close a block; physical newlines and indentation inside a parenthesized continuation are non-structural until its matching `)`;
- §6.8 numeric literals, `&`/`^`/`~`, and the identifier joiner set are lexed as declared, and a malformed literal is reported across its whole run instead of splitting into a name;
- lexer contracts cover every token class, each required boundary spelling, all four indentation cases, and byte-accurate diagnostics including multibyte input;
- the milestone-zero logical-line parser remains only as a temporary semantic projection for the runnable hello slice; milestone 2 replaces it as the authoritative syntax parser.

Lexical diagnostics own the `L` code range and are the sole reporter of every condition listed here; the bootstrap parser keeps the `S` range for the value-level rules it still owns:

```text
L0001 invalid source character
L0002 unterminated block comment
L0003 indentation style
L0004 inconsistent dedent
L0005 joiner-introduced digit unit
L0006 invalid attached operator
L0007 malformed string literal
L0008 block string marker not final
L0009 invalid numeric literal
L0010 comment delimiter inside namespace path
L0011 whitespace around namespace separator
```

The parser now owns grammar-defined continuation and recovery decisions. Blank and comment-only lines continue to emit terminators as part of the lossless lexical contract.

### Milestone 2 — Lossless parser and formatter-ready tree

Deliver:

- namespace declarations;
- namespace-local bindings, typed bindings with and without initializers, visibility modifiers, `global`, and `constant`;
- function declarations and parameter lists;
- block statements and legal empty blocks;
- literals, names, object-form lookup, member access, calls, unary/binary expressions, assignment, grouping, and postfix `++`/`--` as an update *statement* rather than an expression, so a value-position use fails to parse;
- `if`/`else`, `while`, collection and three-clause `for`, `return`, `break`, and `continue` syntax;
- parser recovery at newline and dedent boundaries;
- normalized parse-tree serializer for goldens;
- explicit unsupported-feature nodes or diagnostics for reserved/deferred constructs, including source-declared type parameters, `===` with an explicit equality/type-identity fix, and angle-bracket generic intent in type position with a canonical `list of string` fix, recognized from both the bare trailing `>` and the `>=` spelling.

Highest-risk ambiguities must receive dedicated tests before broad grammar work:

- `print.concat` versus invalid `print .concat` adjacency;
- `.thing` versus the explicit zero-argument call `.thing;`;
- tail-string markers versus comparison and shift operators;
- operator-bearing identifiers, prefix negation, postfix `++`/`--`, and spaced operators;
- namespace `/` separators versus division, and namespace segments versus identifiers;
- call semicolon precedence, named arguments, and grouping of nested calls;
- grouping calls inside the clauses of a three-clause `for`;
- `is a` as identity against an ordinary binding versus type membership when `a` is followed by a complete type expression.

The delivered tree must also preserve sufficient type-expression structure for later resolution of core names, explicitly imported descriptor bindings, union members, constructors, and finite descriptor alternatives without treating fixed-width names as parser keywords.

Invalid adjacency and missing grouping must produce source-oriented diagnostics with valid explicit-semicolon and parenthesized-call fixes; the parser must never repair them silently.

The parser must implement the normative §34 precedence and associativity table, including non-associative comparisons, and mechanically expand the call-free-expression variant used by argument grammar rather than maintaining a second expression grammar.

Exit criterion: every first-version construct has accepted and rejected parse cases; no semantic decision is required merely to recover the intended tree shape.

Implementation status (completed on the `lossless-parser` capability branch):

- the shared `check`, `rust`, `build`, and `run` pipeline now parses authoritative lexer output through one recursive-descent parser before the temporary hello semantic projection;
- compiler-owned syntax nodes retain byte spans, token ranges, child structure, the complete token stream, and trivia, with a deterministic normalized serializer suitable for reviewed goldens;
- declarations, imports, bindings, functions, parameters, legal empty blocks, control flow, assignment clauses, names, object lookup, literals, member/index/postfix expressions, calls, grouping, and the normative unary/binary precedence ladder have dedicated tree shapes;
- the same expression parser implements call-permitted and call-free contexts, including named arguments and grouped nested calls, without a second grammar;
- type nodes preserve unions, prefix forms, constructor application, function types, and ordinary descriptor names for later semantic resolution;
- newline and dedent recovery keeps subsequent statements structurally available, while invalid member adjacency, chained comparisons, ungrouped nested calls, `===`, and angle-bracket generic intent produce source-oriented `S` diagnostics;
- focused accepted and rejected cases cover the milestone grammar, highest-risk ambiguities, structural imports, malformed declarations, recovery boundaries, and exact normalized output; the full workspace suite and a real CLI hello run verify the shared pipeline.

The temporary semantic projection below the syntax tree remains deliberately limited to the milestone-zero runnable hello program. It does not parse independently or bypass syntax diagnostics, and milestone 3 replaces it while adding package, namespace, import, and scope semantics.

Parser diagnostics own the stable `S1xxx` range:

```text
S1001 unexpected layout token             S1017 receiverless member access
S1002 malformed namespace declaration     S1018 unclosed grouped expression
S1003 missing binding name                S1019 missing expression
S1004 missing binding initializer         S1020 malformed function type
S1005 missing `function` keyword          S1021 unclosed grouped type
S1006 invalid function header content     S1022 missing type expression
S1007 malformed parameter                 S1023 missing block newline
S1008 malformed three-clause `for`        S1024 unterminated indented block
S1009 malformed collection `for`          S1025 trailing statement content
S1011 value on a value-free statement     S1026 malformed `from` import
S1012 chained non-associative test        S1027 malformed importer selection
S1013 invalid member adjacency            S1028 malformed collection target
S1014 missing member name                 S1029 invalid declaration prefix
S1015 unclosed index expression           S1030 expression after `try`
S1016 unparenthesized nested call         S1032 missing `catch as` binding
S1033 `try` without `catch`/`finally`     S1034 missing object declaration name
S1035 malformed object clause             S1036 multiple object bases
S1037 assignment in condition             S1038 missing function parameter marker
S1039 missing throwable upper bound       S1040 unclosed function parameter list
S1041 missing object clause name          S1090 reserved unsupported syntax
S1091 unsupported `===`                   S1092 unsupported angle generic
```

`S1010` and `S1031` are intentionally unassigned. Diagnostics whose correction is
not fully expressed by the primary message carry structured help; CLI rendering
prints that help separately from the stable code and message.

Language work must introduce its accepted and rejected cases in the same
vertical work unit as the behavior.

The type-analysis additions through milestones 15–19 reserve and register these
stable diagnostics:

```text
T0052 untyped stored-function parameter   T0061 class field missing initializer
T0053 missing object declaration name     T0062 missing interface member
T0054 invalid object-clause target         T0063 conflicting reused trait member
T0055 unknown object member               T0064 invalid non-owning ref source
T0058 use after move                      T0065 uninferable object field type
T0059 reference used after replacement     T0066 field missing type and initializer
T0067 incompatible interface signature    T0068 escaping non-owning reference
T0070 reflection unavailable in profile     T0074 invalid task-core operation
T0071 unavailable reflected member          T0075 child deadline extension
T0073 value live across suspension           T0076 unconsumed task
T0078 parameterized program entrypoint
```

`T0056`, `T0057`, `T0060`, `T0069`, `T0072`, and `T0077` are intentionally unassigned.

### Milestone 3 — Namespaces, scopes, and bootstrap environment

Deliver:

- a minimal package manifest contract and loader that enumerate the complete source-unit set and select whether the default prelude is enabled;
- a single-file CLI input modeled as an implicit one-unit package with a stable package identity and the default prelude, without filename-to-namespace inference or on-demand namespace search (**superseded by milestone 4.7**, which introduces checked namespace-to-directory correspondence; on-demand search remains excluded);
- namespace tree assembled from the complete manifest-enumerated set of package source units before resolution;
- deterministic multi-file discovery and source-unit assembly order;
- exact root `/` and parent `..` anchoring;
- separate ordinary and object-form symbol tables, with lexical object-form lookup;
- namespace-local, function-local, parameter, and program-global scopes needed by the first version;
- explicit `global` handling for program-global creation/replacement and rejection of plain top-level assignment where a global operation is required;
- duplicate, shadowing, visibility/inaccessibility, unresolved-name, and same-scope object-form collision diagnostics;
- idempotent reimport of the same object-form export, with aliases required for distinct colliding exports;
- fixed bootstrap importer whose milestone-3 module table registers versioned `/core/output`, `/core/types`, `/core/errors`, and `/core/collections` namespaces as structural compiler-owned modules rather than runtime calls; milestone 3 populates the first three, including all fixed-width numeric descriptor objects under `/core/types`, while `/core/collections` remains an empty reserved namespace until the iterator protocol and collections ship in milestones 13 and 14;
- the initial milestone default bindings, superseded by the current contract in which every `/core/types` descriptor is implicit construct vocabulary and the seven ordinary prelude bindings are `print`, `task-scope`, and the five encoding objects;
- import resolution that does not create an ordinary binding automatically, and proof that an ordinary binding named `import` cannot alter structural import syntax or importer selection.

Defer custom importer execution and package acquisition. The initial bootstrap environment may resolve compiler-owned modules from a fixed, versioned table.

Exit criterion: a purpose-built manifest-enumerated multi-file test proves manifest loading, complete source-unit assembly, implicit single-file package identity, symmetric namespace declaration/import resolution, explicit object-to-ordinary binding, lexical object-form lookup, collision and idempotent-reimport rules, prelude enablement and disablement, `global` versus namespace-local assignment, visibility, shadowing, root/parent lookup, and structural import independence from ordinary bindings.

Implemented evidence: package input now uses the authored `package.toml` contract and
deterministically loads its complete enumerated source set before analysis. The shared
semantic pass assembles symmetric namespace declarations, resolves exact root and parent
imports, keeps ordinary and object-form namespaces separate, and records lexical scopes
for parameters, local bindings, assignments, and block-local imports. Import discovery walks the
complete syntax tree, so selective and namespace-wide imports at every lexical depth load bundled
core packages and contribute their capability requirements without widening lexical scope. Its
fixed bootstrap table and exact default prelude are versioned compiler-owned data. Every
`/core/types` descriptor also resolves as an implicit construct independently of prelude selection.
`import /namespace` binds all public function-body objects in source order. It checks the full visible
lookup chain, including enclosing lexical scopes, namespace parents, globals, `/core/types`, and the
prelude, and reports `W4004` before shadowing a different object. A top-level declaration in the
importing namespace always retains its name; a conflicting namespace-wide object is skipped with
`W4004`. Namespace-wide imports otherwise replace one another in normalized relative source-path
order, with the warning attributed to an earlier import binding when that binding is invalidated.
Identical reimports remain idempotent, unsupported public namespace variables are diagnosed
deterministically, and `/deps/*` stays selective until dependency projection supports namespace-wide
imports. Selective import collisions remain `S2011`, and an alias established before a
namespace-wide import retains the earlier object.
Focused accepted and rejected cases cover explicit and namespace-wide binding, declaration
precedence, deterministic cross-file replacement and diagnostic attribution, complete root and
lexical visible-chain warnings, imported core-package replacement, alias preservation, nested import
loading and capability enforcement, visibility, selective collision rules, idempotent reimports,
`global` assignment, legal namespace-local shadowing of program globals, unresolved references,
and ordinary bindings named `import`; manifest-driven multi-source contract tests exercise package
assembly and cross-unit resolution. Semantic phases report the first failure in
deterministic package and source order because subsequent resolution failures can depend
on declarations or imports that the first failure prevented from assembling; manifest
loading instead accumulates its independently discoverable diagnostics.

Semantic diagnostics own the stable `S2xxx` range:

```text
S2001 package or manifest load failure       S2014 retired; do not reuse
S2002 invalid namespace declaration count    S2015 missing package `main`
S2003 anchored namespace declaration         S2016 multiple package `main` functions
S2004 declaration without a name             S2017 compiler-owned namespace declaration
S2005 duplicate namespace declaration        S2018 invalid source identifier
S2006 malformed import                       S2019 reserved namespace segment
S2007 namespace path above root              S2020 namespace-directory mismatch
S2008 import without a name                  S2021 invalid namespace replacement
S2009 unresolved imported name               S2022 constant reassignment
S2010 inaccessible imported name             S2023 initializer self-reference

```

Retired codes remain unavailable so a stable code never acquires a second meaning.

Terrane source warnings own the stable `W4xxx` range:

```text
W4001 initialized local binding is never read
W4002 initial or later store cannot reach a read before definite replacement
W4003 duplicate semantic union arm
W4004 namespace-wide import shadows, replaces, or is skipped for a different visible object
```

Warnings are non-blocking diagnostics. Their codes have the same stability rule as error
codes: retired warning codes remain unavailable and are never reassigned.

### Milestone 4 — Types, calls, and control-flow semantics

Deliver:

- direct native lowering types for `bool`, fixed-width signed and unsigned integers through 128 bits, `float`, the explicit widths `float32` and `float64`, `string`, and `none`, where the Rust representation preserves the complete Terrane contract;
- core `int` as an exact signed integer with adaptive `i64`, `i128`, and arbitrary-precision tiers, including normalization to the smallest exact tier;
- the initial integer support component and lowering hooks for checked tier promotion, exact wide operations, normalization, and capability rejection where arbitrary-precision promotion is unavailable;
- explicit `/core/types` resolution for fixed-width descriptor objects: programs import dot-object descriptors and bind ordinary type names, while the exact default prelude remains unchanged;
- typed literals and inferred local bindings, with destination-range checking applied to every compile-time constant expression and signed fixed-width minima accepted without first rejecting their positive magnitude;
- typed parameters, optional parameters with defaults, and return contracts;
- initialized and uninitialized typed bindings, with definite-assignment analysis rejecting reads before assignment across control flow;
- assignment compatibility without implicit cross-type coercion;
- explicit throwing integer coercion plus checked, wrapping, and saturating policies for `int` and fixed-width integer sources and fixed-width integer destinations, now exposed through the canonical `.coerce`, `.coerce.checked`, `.coerce.wrap`, and `.coerce.saturate` callable family; floating-point and `string` destinations remain rejected with an explicit unsupported-destination diagnostic rather than partially implemented, so `.integer-conversion-overflow` remains the only conversion failure version one can raise.
- unary, arithmetic, shift, bitwise, comparison, Boolean, equality, identity/type-membership, and type-appropriate operator checking;
- exact `int` arithmetic, infinite two's-complement bitwise behavior, exact/arithmetic shifts, and Euclidean division/remainder without inheriting Rust overflow, shift, or signed division behavior;
- fixed-width checked ordinary arithmetic and explicit checked, wrapping, saturating, and overflowing operation families without host debug/release dependence; fixed-width shift counts receive an explicit source-language operation contract rather than inheriting host behavior;
- an interim uncaught-runtime-failure contract for division by zero, fixed-width overflow, integer-conversion overflow, and invalid shifts: preserve the normative error identity and source location, render it deterministically, and exit nonzero while source `throw`/`try`/`catch` remains deferred;
- positional and named argument binding, arity and default checks, explicit zero-argument `;`, and duplicate-argument errors;
- semantic distinction among calls, member access, and dot-objects passed explicitly as ordinary argument values;
- strict left-to-right operand and argument evaluation, receiver-before-selection, exactly-once assignment receiver/index evaluation, `and`/`or` short-circuiting, and call-site defaults after supplied arguments in parameter order;
- truth and core text-display protocols implemented for the supported core types, with `print` consuming canonical scalar display left to right and appending a newline; arbitrary `bytes`, unsupported values, and locale/styled formatting are not guessed; float display must explicitly normalize non-finite spellings to `inf`, `-inf`, and `nan` rather than inherit Rust's `NaN`, while preserving negative zero and shortest round-trippable finite output;
- branch and loop checking, postfix-update placement and integer-family semantics, loop-control placement, unreachable-code facts, and definite return analysis;
- default `string.length` measured in grapheme clusters, either backed by the required segmentation capability or rejected with a capability diagnostic suggesting explicit implemented `bytes`, `scalars`, or `graphemes` views; another unit must never be substituted silently;
- an explicit minimal collection subset for iteration, with mutation accepted only where ordinary assignment cannot expose aliasing that violates deferred universal COW semantics;
- version-one identity restricted to canonical compiler-owned descriptor objects, including type descriptors exposed by `.type`; ordinary scalars, strings, and collections are identity-less, so even `x is x` is false for them, while `===` is rejected with the explicit `left == right and left.type is right.type` spelling;
- canonical type descriptors as source-observable values with stable identity, while version-one type expressions and coercion destinations must resolve to finite compiler-known descriptor alternatives and may be erased only when source behavior is preserved;
- explicit unsupported-feature diagnostics for source-declared type parameters rather than accidental parser or type-checker failures;
- finite dynamic bindings only where all alternatives lower soundly without a universal box; because version one knows every alternative in such a binding, protocol availability and typed-boundary compatibility are checked statically, so unsupported text display or argument compatibility is rejected at compile time rather than entering the interim runtime-failure contract.

Core text display and receiver-based text behavior must be exercised through the canonical object model, including integer output:

```terrane
message = ': '.join; project-name, build-target, build-status
print; message
print; completed-count
```

Exit criterion: semantic and lowering conformance for a program that exercises the same contracts as `fizz-buzz` and `build-report` proves the specified integer, canonical scalar text-display, type-descriptor, call, evaluation-order, and control-flow behavior; generated crates compile and run through the existing pipeline, while plausible type, call, definite-assignment, arithmetic-failure, shift/bitwise, display, descriptor-resolution, and capability mistakes fail at Terrane source spans. If the text-display protocol is not yet implemented when milestone 4 begins, the initial executable fixture may print literal strings only, but integer-rendering conformance is required before the milestone exits.

Implemented evidence: the compiler now resolves compiler-owned and imported scalar
descriptors, infers and checks typed bindings, parameters, defaults, returns, calls,
operators, assignments, branches, loops, updates, and finite descriptor alternatives.
Native fixed-width values lower directly to Rust with checked default arithmetic and
shift operations; adaptive `int` operations use the dedicated exact-integer support
crate. Deterministic source-oriented failures cover unsupported or invalid arithmetic and
coercion paths. Canonical scalar display, grapheme-counted string length, descriptor identity,
and value-type identity are checked before lowering. Collection values remain deferred until
the iterator protocol and collections ship in milestones 13 and 14; the only iterable
implemented today is `string`, whose `for` loop visits grapheme clusters. Manifest-driven
accepted cases and focused rejected cases exercise these semantic boundaries, while semantic
unit tests cover the broader diagnostic set. The conformance
corpus includes adaptive logical comparisons, destination-aware returns, assignments, and
lengths, fixed-width overflow, invalid member receivers, compound membership and identity,
and identity operand evaluation order. The `fizz-buzz`, `build-report`,
`grouped-precedence`, and focused regression run cases compile generated crates with
warnings denied and verify their observable output, stderr, and exit status.

### Milestone 4.5 — Canonical coercion object model

Milestone 4 delivered the integer contracts but its flat `checked-coerce`,
`wrapping-coerce`, and `saturating-coerce` spellings contradict the canonical callable
family specified by `docs/surface-v1.md`. This is release-blocking semantic debt, not a
compatibility layer or a deferred additive feature.

Deliver:

- a compiler-owned, statically resolved `.coerce` callable family with throwing default,
  `.checked`, `.wrap`, and `.saturate` policies, using the complete
  `(source type, destination type, policy)` lookup table;
- member-chain resolution that evaluates the receiver exactly once and checks availability
  only after the statically known destination is supplied;
- clean migration of every integer coercion callsite, fixture, diagnostic, and golden to
  `value.coerce; T`, `value.coerce.checked; T`, `value.coerce.wrap; T`, or
  `value.coerce.saturate; T`; the flat spellings are rejected, with no aliases;
- source-oriented rejections for unsupported policy/type pairs and for extracting a
  coercion family as a value before bound-method values exist;
- deterministic lowering that erases the statically resolved family while preserving the
  distinct throwing, partial, wrapping, and saturating result contracts;
- accepted and rejected conformance cases covering every integer policy, receiver
  single-evaluation, canonical generated Rust, and the absence of the obsolete spellings.

Exit criterion: canonical grouped coercion cases compile and run with warnings denied,
flat spellings fail at Terrane source spans, and no compiler-facing documentation or
fixture presents them as valid syntax.

Implemented evidence: the compiler resolves the canonical `.coerce` callable family and
its `.checked`, `.wrap`, and `.saturate` children through one typed policy resolver shared
by semantic analysis and lowering. This is compiler-owned semantic object metadata rather
than four independent direct-invocation paths: lowering erases the resolved family and
policy to backend support calls without exposing those helper names as Terrane members.
Availability is keyed by source type, destination type, and policy; unsupported pairs,
unknown policy chains, escaped family values, and obsolete flat spellings fail at Terrane
source spans. Accepted conformance cases cover every policy, including both absent and
present membership for checked results, a package-level adaptive integer receiver,
parameter-sourced coercion inside a typed function, and a side-effecting function-call
receiver proving exactly-once evaluation. Reviewed generated-Rust goldens preserve the
throwing, partial, wrapping, and saturating result contracts without redundant references,
and every accepted generated crate compiles with warnings denied.

### Milestone 4.6 — Reconcile shipped behavior with the settled decisions

Milestones 3 and 4 shipped against contracts that have since changed. This milestone
closes the gap between what the compiler does and what the specification now says, so that
later work is not built on top of superseded behavior. It adds no new language surface:
every item here is a divergence in something already implemented.

Deliver:

- rename the compiler-owned collection namespace from `/collections` to `/core/collections`
  in the bootstrap module table, the namespace registry, and every diagnostic and fixture
  that names it. The empty placeholder is removed rather than aliased, per the clean-cutover
  rule;
- record descriptor constructs as available without import, a category distinct from the seven
  prelude ordinary bindings, which are unchanged. `value int8 = 42` needs no import today and
  should not start needing one; the specification text stating that fixed widths require
  explicit import and binding predates the construct model and is what changes here. Explicit
  import and aliasing remain available and are still how a name is rebound or shadowed;
- implement descriptors as language constructs backed by canonical objects rather than as
  independently instantiated values. A descriptor binding such as `d = int8` names the
  construct and is a compile-time alias, so a statically resolved use needs no runtime storage
  and lowers to nothing. Today `d = int` passes `terrane check` and emits `d = int;` into
  generated Rust, handing the user a projected rustc `E0425` instead of a Terrane diagnostic —
  the exact failure milestone 6 forbids. The defect is emitting a plain Rust binding as if the
  descriptor were an ordinary value; a descriptor may still be materialised as its canonical
  object where reflection or dynamic descriptor use requires it (milestone 18);
- accept a descriptor alias everywhere the construct is valid — annotation position, a
  coercion destination, and the right side of `is a` — which fixes the currently rejected
  `target-type = float` followed by `x.coerce; target-type` that the specification documents;
- reject a descriptor alias at its source span wherever a runtime value is required, including
  `print; d`, arithmetic, and value parameters, since a descriptor has no display or value
  protocol in version one;
- fix `.concat` lowering when its result is bound. `m = sep.concat; 'a', 'b'` emits
  `m = format!(...)` with no `let`, so the generated Rust does not compile and the user
  receives a projected rustc `E0425`. Binding a `.length` or `.coerce` result emits `let`
  correctly, so the defect is specific to `concat`. The conformance corpus never binds a
  concat result — every fixture passes it straight to `print` — which is why it was not
  caught, so the fix ships with a fixture that binds one;

- align the `/core/errors` object set and its diagnostic text with the structural `error`
  interface now specified — stable `kind`, human-readable `message`, optional `cause`, and a
  source-context chain — even though construction and catching remain later work. Reserved
  names must not imply a shape the specification has since replaced;
- re-check every rejection message written against a superseded spelling. Diagnostics that
  suggest a flat coercion spelling, a `/collections` path, or an operation name the arithmetic
  family decision renamed must be corrected, since a diagnostic is a contract surface;
- refresh `docs/surface-today.md` so each entry matches the reconciled behavior, and
  re-verify the status labels rather than assuming they carried over.

Exit criterion: no compiler-owned name, diagnostic, fixture, or golden refers to a
superseded contract; a descriptor alias is accepted in every construct position and rejected
with a Terrane diagnostic in every value position, never reaching rustc; and
`docs/surface-today.md` agrees with the pipeline entry for entry.

Note on scope: the arithmetic families, abstract category descriptors, structured errors,
and float/string coercion destinations are **not** part of this milestone. They are new
surface rather than corrections, and they arrive with milestones 7 onward.

Implemented evidence: the collection namespace is registered as `/core/collections`. Type
descriptors behave as constructs — a descriptor in value position fails with a Terrane
diagnostic rather than reaching rustc, while construct positions including a coercion
destination accept a descriptor bound under another name. Binding a `.concat` result emits a
correct Rust binding. `/core/errors` exposes `error` as an interface symbol. `surface-today.md`
was refreshed with the rest of the corpus.

### Milestone 4.7 — Namespace path syntax, name casing, and directory correspondence

Milestone 3 shipped whitespace-separated namespace paths with no relationship between a
namespace and its location on disk. Both decisions have been reversed. This milestone
implements the replacement and migrates everything already built on the old form.

Deliver:

- `/` as the single namespace boundary marker, anchoring the root and separating every
  segment: `namespace my-app/http/handlers`, `from /core/output import .print`,
  `from ../shared/config import .settings`. Repeated parents nest as ordinary path
  components, replacing the `.. ..` form, which does not scale and reads as a typo;
- removal of `/` from the identifier-joiner set. A character cannot be both a joiner and the
  namespace separator without making `namespace foo/bar` ambiguous between one segment and
  two, and context-sensitive lexing would contradict the rule that a compact joiner sequence
  is always an identifier. `ipv4/ipv6` becomes `ipv4-ipv6`; update the Rust-name encoding,
  which currently escapes the slash;
- the segment grammar `[a-z]([a-z0-9]|-[a-z0-9])*`, enforced as an allowlist so that every
  filesystem-hazardous character is unformable rather than blocklisted, plus the reserved
  whole-name set `con`, `prn`, `aux`, `nul`, `com1`–`com9`, `lpt1`–`lpt9`, which is made of
  legal characters and therefore invisible to the allowlist. Reserve them now even though
  version one targets Linux first, because adding the restriction later breaks existing names;
- lowercase enforcement for every user-declared name, with uppercase parsing and then failing
  semantically with a diagnostic naming the lowercase form and a formatter fixit. Never fold
  silently: that is the silent repair principle 5 forbids. Type parameters remain uppercase;
- namespace-to-directory correspondence, with a declaration that disagrees with its location
  rejected unless the manifest declares that mapping; manifest namespace-root to
  directory-root mappings resolved by longest prefix; two roots mapped to one directory
  rejected at manifest load;
- bounded discovery over declared roots with sorted expansion, a dependency's namespaces read
  from its own manifest rather than by scanning its tree, and the resolved source set recorded
  in build metadata so a build stays auditable once the manifest no longer enumerates files;
- migration of every fixture, golden, example, and document to the new path syntax.

Also in scope, because it is the same migration:

- implement `string.join`, whose receiver is the separator and whose arguments are the parts,
  distinct from the existing `concat`, which appends without one. It is scheduled here rather
  than with the string families because it depends on nothing: `concat` already lowers
  correctly, and `join` is the same shape with a separator interleaved. It needs no descriptor
  model, callable-family machinery, error propagation, or byte views. Two things make it
  release-blocking earlier than its neighbours — milestone 4 is already delivered and its own
  text-composition example uses `': '.join`, and the specification's representative program,
  the first code any reader meets, uses it too. A flagship example that cannot run is the same
  defect class as the redundant imports removed below. Specify the boundary cases from the
  string-composition section: an empty call yields the empty string, a single argument yields
  that argument with no separator, and the separator never precedes the first or follows the
  last part;
- remove the redundant prelude imports from the conformance corpus. Fixtures currently open
  with `from /core/output import .print` and `print = .print`, but the prelude and descriptor
  constructs already make those unnecessary — `tests/conformance/run/fixed-overflow/case.trn`
  behaves identically with no import lines at all, including its expected `.arithmetic-overflow`
  failure. No compiler change is required; the fixtures teach a pattern the language does not
  need, and every reader copies it. Keep explicit imports only in cases that are specifically
  about importing, aliasing, or shadowing.

Scope warning: the specification and both surface maps already describe the settled version-one
design, which includes the single-lookup-view model that milestone 4.8 delivers. Every import
example in those documents is therefore written without the dot-prefixed form. That form is
still valid until 4.8 lands, so an implementer of this milestone migrates namespace *paths* and
leaves name *forms* alone:

```text
from /core output import .print     ->  from /core/output import .print
```

The path gains its separator; the dot-prefixed name and the `print = .print` binding that
follows it both stay until 4.8. Reading the specification alone will suggest more change than
this milestone authorises.

Exit criterion: no document, fixture, golden, or example uses a whitespace-separated namespace
path; a slash in an identifier is a lexical error; an uppercase or reserved segment fails with
a source-span diagnostic naming the correction; a misplaced source file fails the correspondence
check unless the manifest maps it; the conformance corpus contains no redundant prelude import;
and the specification's representative program compiles and runs, producing its documented
output exactly.

Implemented evidence: namespace declarations and imports now use `/` between every segment,
and declared names are checked for canonical lowercase spelling and reserved namespace
segments. Authored manifests map namespace roots to distinct relative directories; package
loading recursively discovers `.trn` files within those bounded roots in sorted path order,
assigns each declaration its longest-prefix expected namespace, and rejects duplicate,
missing, or mismatched roots before semantic resolution. `string.join` validates and lowers
through the shared call pipeline with empty, singleton, and multi-part conformance coverage.
The migrated corpus has no redundant default-prelude imports, and the representative
program runs with the documented output.

### Milestone 4.8 — Collapse the two-namespace lookup model

Milestone 3 shipped separate ordinary and object-form symbol tables, so an import made
`.print` available and the program then wrote `print = .print` to bind the ordinary name.
That second view is removed. There is one lookup view, and `.` appears only between a
receiver and its member.

Deliver:

- one symbol table and one lookup chain. The `object_form` discriminator on symbols and
  declarations, and the paired table selection it drives, are removed rather than left
  defaulted;
- `from path import name` binding an ordinary name directly in the scope containing the
  import, with `as` renaming it. The declare-then-bind step disappears, and with it every
  `print = .print` line in the corpus;
- a leading `.` in expression position rejected at its source span. This is the diagnostic
  that replaces object-form lookup, so it must name the receiver form rather than reporting an
  unresolved name;
- collision, shadowing, visibility, and idempotent-reimport rules restated over the single
  view. The two-view versions of those rules go away, not merely one of their branches;
- `import with selector` resolving its operand through ordinary lexical scope;
- migration of the reject fixtures that currently encode the two-view model:
  `import-collision` and `private-import` import `.item` and `.secret` and must keep failing
  for the same reasons under the new spelling, while `unresolved-object` currently binds
  `print = .missing` and needs a form that still exercises an unresolved import;
- collapse `float` and `float64` to one descriptor. They are separate `ScalarType` variants
  today, so a value declared `float` answers `false` to `is a float64`. Point float-literal
  inference and the `float` name at `Float64` and drop the variant; the value contract is
  identical, so diagnostics name `float64` for either spelling and nothing downstream changes.
  `float32` is untouched;
- restrict the namespace tiers of the lookup chain to what may cross a function boundary. A body
  resolves constants, descriptor constructs, imported names, functions, and types from the
  namespace tiers, and never a namespace variable. A variable's value depends on when it is read,
  so a body that can name one takes execution order as an implicit input, which is what parameters
  and returns exist to express. The namespace tier is where a variable composes a value; `constant`,
  `global`, a parameter, or a return is how one leaves. Today the tier is unrestricted and
  `run/declarations` reads a namespace variable inside `main`, so this inverts a shipped behaviour
  and the fixture becomes the test of the new rule;
- confine a namespace variable to its own namespace: not a descendant namespace, not an importer.
  `public` on one is meaningless rather than redundant and is rejected, unlike every other
  declaration where the marker is permitted as documentation;
- reject renaming by ordinary binding. A construct is renamed where it enters the scope, so
  `from /core/types import int8 as byte` stands and `byte = int8` does not — milestone 4.6 accepted
  the binding form, and `checked-coercion` (`tiny = .int8`) and `numeric-literals`
  (`signed`, `unsigned`) use it. One spelling per name in a scope is worth more than a second
  aliasing mechanism, and holding a type in a value to dispatch or instantiate through it is a
  distinct capability that arrives with reflection in milestone 18 rather than borrowing assignment
  syntax now;
- allow a declaration to replace an earlier binding of the same name in the same lexical scope, with
  the initializer reading the earlier binding: `a int8 = 12` followed by `a int = a.coerce; int`.
  `S2012` rejects this today, and `S2023` rejects the initializer's read, so both change. An
  identical type is an assignment with a redundant annotation; every replacement evaluates the
  initializer, releases the previous owned identity, and installs the replacement. A changed type
  also changes the binding's type. The rule is lexical: `S2005` continues to reject a replacement at
  namespace top level, where initialization is ordered by dependency rather than source position.
  Reference invalidation and continued shared ownership belong with milestone 17;
- rewrite the assignment and visibility diagnostics so none of them advertises `global`. A fixit is
  read when the author is most willing to be told what to do, so it should teach the value path —
  a parameter, a return, or `constant` where the value never varies. `S2021` currently says
  `use 'global counter = ...'`, which routes an author from a caught error toward program-wide
  mutable state as the shortcut rather than the exception. `global` stays documented in the
  specification for the cases that need it;
- migration of every remaining fixture, golden, example, and document.

Exit criterion: no source anywhere in the repository contains a leading `.` outside member
position; a program that writes one fails with a diagnostic naming the receiver form; the
collision, visibility, and shadowing cases fail for their original reasons under single-view
lookup; no compiler type carries an object-form discriminator; a value declared `float`
answers `true` to `is a float64`, with one descriptor reported by `.type` and by diagnostics; a
function body that names a namespace variable fails at its source span, while a `constant`, a
construct, an imported name, and a `global` all resolve there; `public` on a namespace variable
fails; `byte = int8` fails while `from /core/types import int8 as byte` succeeds; `a int8 = 12` followed by
`a int = a.coerce; int` compiles and runs in a function body while the same pair at namespace top
level still fails; and no diagnostic in the compiler names `global` as a suggested fix.

Sequencing note: milestone 4.7 changes namespace *paths* and this milestone changes *name
forms*. Both migrate the whole corpus, so running them back to back keeps the fixture churn
to two passes rather than interleaving it through later work. They are separate milestones
because they are separate language changes with separate exit criteria, not because the
migrations are independent.

Implemented evidence: the compiler now assembles one symbol table per namespace and resolves
imports, lexical names, namespace names, program globals, and prelude names through one lookup
view. Leading-dot receiverless expressions fail with `S1017`; member dots remain receiver-only.
Collision, visibility, shadowing, construct-import, and descriptor-import cases exercise the
single view. `float` resolves to the canonical `float64` descriptor. Function bodies reject
namespace-local variables and accept explicit globals, constants, constructs, and imports;
namespace variables reject `public`. Plain assignment no longer aliases compile-time constructs,
while same-scope local replacement is source-ordered, initializer-safe, and lowered as Rust
shadowing. The conformance corpus, unit fixtures, generated-Rust goldens, and exploratory demos
use the canonical spellings.


### Milestone 4.9 — Numeric destination conversion and contextual constant arithmetic

The specification previously required an explicit `coerce` at every numeric type crossing and
confined contextual constant typing to fixed-width binding initializers. Both have been replaced by
one rule: a numeric value reaching a declared numeric destination arrives exactly or throws, and a
constant expression is evaluated in the arithmetic its destination or typed operand selects. This
milestone implements that rule across semantics and lowering, and migrates the corpus that was
written against the old one.

Deliver:

- constant-expression evaluation in destination context. An integer destination folds the whole
  expression exactly with unbounded intermediates, including Euclidean `/`, and checks only the final
  value; a floating destination folds operation by operation at destination precision so the result
  matches runtime arithmetic. Admission tests the value a constant denotes rather than its spelling,
  so `count int = 4.0` is `4`, `count int = 4.2` is rejected, and `ratio float = 1 / 3` performs
  floating division. The existing single-literal parser and `T0003` range check generalise into this;
  parenthesised and folded constant expressions are specified today and not implemented;
- the destination-context set: typed binding initialization and assignment, parameter default,
  argument matched to a declared parameter, return against a declared return type, and declared
  element or field. Arguments and returns currently reject admissible constants at `T0012` and
  `T0015`;
- operand context. A constant takes the type of a statically typed numeric operand, with shift counts
  exempt and governed by §17.6. Two integer values of different concrete types promote to the
  smallest integer type containing both source ranges, or `int` where no fixed width does. Integer
  and floating value mixtures, and unrelated categories, stay rejected;
- numeric destination conversion as one predicate over source and destination ranges: exact widening
  lowers to a representation change with no check and no failure path; every other pair is admitted
  with a check that throws `integer-conversion-overflow`. This covers integer narrowing, integer to
  floating where the value must be exactly representable, and floating to integer where it must be
  finite, integral, and in range. Acceptance is decided by declared types and constant evaluation
  alone — range knowledge may delete a check and must never decide validity;
- the floating rounding members `round`, `floor`, `ceiling`, and `truncate`, each yielding an
  integer, with `round` pinned to ties-to-even. No floating-to-integer pair is declared on `coerce`,
  because selecting an integer for a fractional value requires a mode and `coerce` takes none;
- union destination selection: exact type match first, otherwise the unique admitting arm, otherwise
  a compile-time ambiguity naming the candidates. Arm order never decides;
- `is a` against a numeric constant answers whether the constant can become that type, returning
  `false` for an inadmissible one rather than raising the constant-range error a destination would.
  A typed operand keeps type membership. Independently of that rule, `is a` must resolve its
  right-hand side: an unresolvable name currently answers `false` instead of failing at its span,
  which is a resolution defect rather than the absent category descriptors of milestone 7;
- numeric lowering that matches the source contract. A contextual constant materialises directly in
  its destination representation; an exact widening selects the `int` tier from the source range and
  emits no check; a checked conversion narrows, widens back, compares, and branches. An implicit
  narrowing and an equivalent written `coerce` emit equivalent code, and neither routes a statically
  known fixed-width source through the generic support-crate conversion behind `unwrap_or_fail`. A
  statically known `int` binding in the Small tier lowers to a machine word rather than constructing
  the erased wrapper and cloning it per operand;
- migration of every fixture, golden, example, and demo written against required coercion, including
  the coercions the new rule makes unnecessary.

Exit criterion: a function declaring a fixed-width return compiles `return 1` and lowers it to a
bare literal with no support-crate call; the Mandelbrot demo compiles without a companion binding
per literal and without a written coercion; `a int8 = 12` followed by `a int = a` compiles and runs,
and the written form still compiles; `wide int32 = small` emits no check while `narrow; 128` through
an `int8` contract throws `integer-conversion-overflow` naming the value and destination;
`total float = count` runs for an `int32` count with no check, and throws at `2^53 + 1` while
succeeding at `2^54`; `count int = ratio` yields `4` from `4.0` and throws from `4.2`, `nan`, and
both infinities, while `ratio.round;` yields `4` from `4.2`; `count int = (1 / 3)` and
`ratio float = (1 / 3)` print `0` and the floating quotient in one program; `limit int8 = (1000 -
900)` compiles; a constant out of range reports `T0003` at the constant's span in argument, return,
and operand position; `flags int8 = 1` with `flags << 200` reports an out-of-width shift count rather
than a constant-range error; `left int8 + right int` computes in `int` while `counter int8 = 127`
with `counter + 1` throws `arithmetic-overflow`; a fixed-width value in an `int|none` destination
widens while the constant `5` in `int8|int32` is rejected as ambiguous; and `is a` fails at its span
on an unresolvable right-hand name.

Implemented evidence: semantic analysis now evaluates numeric constants in destination and typed-operand context, including exact integer folding, destination-precision floating folding, Euclidean division, shifts, and bitwise operators. Typed bindings, assignments, parameter defaults, declared call arguments, and declared returns share one exact-arrival validation path. Lowering materialises contextual constants directly, uses representation-only fixed-width widening, emits checked integer/floating crossings with source-oriented `integer-conversion-overflow` details, and keeps statically proven Small `int` locals as machine words. Numeric union bindings retain compiler-owned arm metadata, reject ambiguous constants independently of arm order, preserve the selected runtime arm across assignment, and answer `is a` from that arm. Focused conformance cases cover exact and inexact float narrowing, contextual floating literals, ambiguous union initialization and reassignment, conversion boundaries, operand promotion, and runtime failures.

Checked fixed-width integer-to-floating crossings now stay in their native Rust representations:
the support path decides exactness from magnitude, bit length, and discarded low bits, then performs
one primitive cast. Boundary conformance covers signed and unsigned sources through 128 bits for
both floating widths, including caught inexact arrivals; only adaptive `int` uses the arbitrary-
precision conversion path.

Milestone 5 must preserve the Small-tier proof for an unnecessary written `coerce; int`, so it
lowers identically to the equivalent implicit conversion instead of materialising the erased
adaptive-integer wrapper.

Deferred out of this milestone and recorded in specification §40.9: the exact-arrival predicate for a
typed value, proposed as `value.fits; Destination`; the statically false `is a` lint and the lossy
constant-division lint; whether `integer-conversion-overflow` keeps a name that now covers neither
only integers nor only overflow. Abstract category descriptors remain milestone 7, so `is a integer`
is not answered here.

Sequencing note: this is semantic and lowering work inside the existing pipeline, not the Rust IR
rework. It precedes milestone 5 so that the IR is built against the settled numeric contract rather
than being retrofitted to it, and so the corpus migrates once.

### Milestone 5 — Rust IR, readable emission, and Cargo builds

Deliver:

- explicit Rust-oriented lowering IR;
- deterministic module and item ordering;
- injective source-name-to-Rust-name encoding;
- direct fixed-width scalar and function lowering where Rust preserves the source contract;
- integration of the adaptive core-`int` support component into the explicit Rust IR, preserving checked tier promotion, exact wide operations, result normalization, normative runtime failures, and target capability diagnostics;
- structured expression/block emission with a pinned formatter policy, including the nesting threshold at which the formatter reports a call better bound to a named intermediate;
- generated `Cargo.toml`, source tree, compiler metadata, and entrypoint;
- deterministic inclusion of the integer support crate by copying compiler-bundled, content-addressed source into the generated build directory and referring to it by a generated-project-relative Cargo path, without registry, network, or install-location paths; the bundled source content identity enters the build key, and the same vendoring mechanism applies to any authored third-party dependency admitted later;
- content-addressed build directory keyed by compiler version, source inputs, target, and relevant options;
- package-level artifact caching, keyed the same way, so a package compiles once per identity rather than once per dependent build. Delivery principle 9 makes this load-bearing rather than an optimisation: a Terrane-source standard library is recompiled by every build without it;
- `cargo check`, build, and run process wrappers with captured structured output;
- `terrane rust` output or path display suitable for inspection, clearly distinguishing authored generated modules from vendored support source.

Generated artifacts should be organized under a project-local ignored directory or a user cache, never mixed with authored source. A `--keep-generated` or stable development path may expose them intentionally.

Exit criterion: identical inputs produce byte-identical generated files; all accepted compile cases
pass Cargo; the generated Rust for representative fixtures is readable and has reviewed goldens.
Goldens pin canonical float display at both `float32` and `float64` width for `nan`, `inf`, `-inf`,
negative zero, and shortest round-trippable finite values; they pin one multi-argument `print` call
proving that arguments render adjacently with no inserted separator and exactly one trailing
newline, alongside adjacent `print` calls proving record separation; and generated-project coverage
pins the authored entrypoint, its compiler-support sidecar, and the vendored support copies.

Implemented evidence: lowering now produces one deterministic rendered-program artifact with
separate compiler-support and authored-application bodies, uses injective source-name encoding, and
renders either a complete standalone translation unit or a caller-named split entrypoint. Named
output derives one sibling `<entrypoint-stem>.support.rs`; the entrypoint contains a relative
`include!`, source and namespace associations, and user-authored package lowering, while
compiler-owned prelude, runtime, structured-error and source-site infrastructure, selectively
included bundled `/core` implementations, and projected `/deps` lowering stay in the support file.
The sidecar is emitted even when empty so every named lowering has one stable two-file
shape. The compiler does not invent a named output path: `check`, `build`, and `run` explicitly
request `src/main.rs`, which derives `src/main.support.rs`, through the same renderer. `terrane rust`
streams the complete
standalone form by default and accepts `--output`/`-o` to write the split form.
Every lowered item is parsed into a compiler-owned `syn` syntax tree before entering the rendered
model. A structural normalization pass removes redundant expression parentheses both from ordinary
Rust syntax and from macro bodies that parse as comma-separated expression lists; `prettyplease`
reconstructs only parentheses required by Rust precedence, while normalized borrow tokens retain
conventional compact spelling inside otherwise opaque macro input. Generated module-association
comments survive that canonicalization wherever they occur in the combined entrypoint.
The renderer and the default-off `--require-canonical-rust` development check share that exact
normalization and pinned formatting path. The check reports mismatch as compiler defect `S9004` and
never repairs or replaces generator output. Generated projects contain copied content-addressed
support crates, manifests, compiler/source metadata, and a build identity covering compiler version,
source and support content, target, profile, and command-relevant environment. Successful checks
and native executables are retained under that identity; stale generated identities are bounded by
last use. `build --release` and `run --release` select Cargo's optimized release profile, with
development and release executables cached separately. Generated release manifests explicitly
enable ThinLTO with Cargo's default codegen-unit count; this is a toolchain policy for every
generated crate rather than benchmark-specific source tuning. `check`, `build`, and `run` share
captured Cargo execution when an artifact is absent. Pipeline and CLI tests pin standalone byte
identity, custom output naming and disk writes, support/error separation, source associations,
generated-crate compilation, artifact reuse and eviction, and strict canonical-format rejection;
compile/run conformance cases validate the generated crates with warnings denied.

Remaining milestone-5 work: lowering still initially constructs item bodies as Rust text before the
mandatory parse and structural normalization boundary. A fully structural expression/statement
builder and a named-intermediate nesting policy therefore remain assigned to this milestone. The
parsed item model prevents further raw rendered-text expansion, but does not by itself satisfy that
complete deliverable.

### Milestone 6 — Source diagnostics across Rust

Deliver:

- basic source associations from semantic nodes to generated Rust spans;
- JSON-formatted Cargo/rustc diagnostic ingestion;
- projection of backend errors to the most relevant Terrane span;
- raw Rust diagnostic retained as a note or opt-in detail;
- stable diagnostic codes and CLI rendering with color policy;
- distinction among source errors, uncaught source-language runtime failures, compiler defects, Rust toolchain failures, and ordinary user-program exits; normative runtime failures render Terrane namespace/function frames and source spans, retain generated Rust frames only as expandable detail, and never surface as raw Rust panics or backtraces;
- internal-error reports that preserve generated artifacts and reproduction metadata.

The frontend should prevent ordinary type/name errors from reaching rustc. Backend translation exists for missed constraints, target failures, generated-code defects, and handwritten/toolchain boundaries—not as a substitute for semantic analysis.

Exit criterion: at least one deliberately induced backend error is mapped to its Terrane source location, and raw rustc information remains available.

Implemented evidence: authored Rust items retain Terrane spans through lowering, Cargo is consumed as
JSON, and the CLI projects the primary backend span back to the associated Terrane source location
while retaining raw rustc output as a note. Stable backend, toolchain, and compiler-defect codes are
rendered through the same diagnostic type; compiler defects preserve the generated project and
report its reproduction path. CLI tests induce a backend failure and verify source projection.

### Milestone 7 — Semantic descriptor, protocol, and category model

Deliver:

- compiler-owned abstract category descriptors `number`, `integer`, `fixed-integer`, `signed-fixed-integer`, `unsigned-fixed-integer`, and `floating`, beneath the `value` and `object` identity roots, exported from `/core/types` and never prelude names;
- declared conformance on every concrete scalar descriptor, replacing the enumerated match arms and "is integer" predicates that currently encode category membership;
- category-driven member attachment, compatibility, and finite-union reasoning, so a member set is derived from declared contracts rather than from a per-type list;
- the declared-conversion protocol behind `coerce`, with `coerce` fixed as option-free; the `parse` member taking a required, statically resolvable callback and typed by that callback's declared return, including its `checked` child; and the `radix` pair interpreting base-N text to `int` and rendering `int` to `string`;
- explicit rejection of fixed-width integers as assignment-compatible subtypes of `int`, preserving explicit coercion and the differing arithmetic contracts;
- a compiler-owned descriptor schema carrying bounds, bit width, signedness, and declared protocols, kept separate from generated-Rust representation metadata.

Exit criterion: category membership drives at least one real decision the compiler previously made by enumeration, `is a` answers abstract descriptors correctly, and no scalar is boxed merely to model source conformance.

Implemented evidence: compiler-owned descriptor schemas declare category membership, which drives
`is a` and numeric classification without runtime boxing. Scalar representation facts such as
bounds, widths, and signedness remain canonical `ScalarType` contracts rather than being duplicated
in the category schema. `/core/types` exports category descriptors as explicit-only names. Accepted
and rejected conformance cases cover abstract membership and descriptor misuse.

### Milestone 8 — Callable signatures and bound-method families

Milestone 4.5 delivered the `.coerce` family as a special case. This generalises that machinery so later families reuse it instead of adding parallel special cases.

Deliver:

- general member-family, bound-method, callable-signature, and member-availability semantic forms, with the coercion family re-expressed in terms of them;
- typed child lookup and explicit default invocation in the model rather than in name matching;
- one call-checking path shared by ordinary function calls and member calls;
- member lookup returning typed candidates and availability constraints instead of a boolean "known member", with destination narrowing applied before call validation;
- the version-one restriction that a family selection must be invoked in the same expression, diagnosed at its source span.

Exit criterion: adding a new member family requires no new parser or lowering route, proven by re-expressing coercion and adding one further family through the shared path only.

Implemented evidence: semantic analysis represents member families and bound methods explicitly.
Coercion, parse, and radix share family binding, immediate-invocation validation, receiver and
argument checks, and child selection; lowering consumes the same bound-method result for all three
families. Their result rules intentionally remain in two semantic helpers: numeric destination
coercion is destination-driven, while parse/radix typing is callback- or receiver-driven. Converge
those helpers only when milestone 15 introduces first-class function values and a common callable
candidate model. Conformance cases exercise default and checked children, callback-derived return
types, radix in both directions, and source diagnostics for invalid receivers, callback signatures,
and arguments.

### Milestone 9 — Structured errors and typed propagation

Deliver:

- the structural `error` interface with stable `kind`, human-readable `message`, optional `cause`, and a source-context chain;
- `throw`, `try`, `catch`, and `finally` over a compiler-owned result propagation representation rather than native unwinding;
- catch matching in source order, with a compile-time diagnostic for a clause made unreachable by an earlier one;
- `finally` semantics that always run and may replace a pending outcome only by explicitly returning or throwing;
- construction and catchability for the reserved `/core/errors` objects, converting the existing deterministic arithmetic and coercion failures onto this path;
- deterministic uncaught rendering of the cause and source chain, preserving the current outermost reporting policy and exit code.

Exit criterion: an arithmetic overflow and a failed coercion are catchable, a rethrow preserves the cause chain, uncaught output is unchanged from the current normative text, and generated Rust contains no panic-based control flow for recoverable failures.

Implemented evidence at milestone completion: `throw`, ordered typed and catch-all `catch`, `try`,
bare rethrow, and `finally` lowered through compiler-owned completion and `Result` flow rather than
unwinding. The first implementation used a closed compiler-owned error kind and a prefix `throws`
declaration. Milestone 18 deliberately replaces those provisional restrictions with ordinary
throwable classes, inferred escaping sets, and optional postfix upper-bound contracts. Arithmetic
and exact-conversion failures already enter the shared recoverable propagation path. Conformance
cases catch overflow and failed conversion, exercise checked callback failure, bare rethrow,
catch-all ordering, and unconditional finally execution. A CLI runtime case observes a chained
uncaught throwable with Terrane frames and the established exit status; reviewed Rust goldens
contain no panic-based recoverable control flow.

### Milestone 10 — Named bounded-arithmetic families

Deliver:

- the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `remainder`, `div-rem`, `negate`, `shift-left`, and `shift-right` families attached to `integer`, with operators selecting each default child;
- `checked`, `wrap`, `saturate`, and `overflowing` children attached to `fixed-integer` only, absent from adaptive `int` rather than present as runtime no-ops;
- `int` exposing its throwing default always and `checked` only where genuinely fallible;
- `overflow-result of T` and `div-rem-result of T` as named compiler-supplied result types, with `div-rem` lowering to one backend operation;
- shift-count policy per receiver class, and postfix `++`/`--` restricted to the default child.

Exit criterion: every family and child has accepted, rejected, and runtime cases; `div-rem` divides once in reviewed generated Rust; and absent children fail at the source span rather than at runtime.
Implemented evidence: all nine integer member families lower through one semantic and
backend route. Fixed-width policy children produce typed optional or overflow-result
objects; adaptive unavailable children fail during semantic analysis. Runtime conformance
covers default, checked, wrap, saturate, overflowing, shift, `div-rem`, and postfix update
paths, and the reviewed `div-rem` golden contains one combined support operation.


### Milestone 11 — Bytes, string views, and encoding objects

Deliver:

- `bytes` as a real sequence value with literals, byte length, built-in iteration, and no text-display protocol; indexing and slicing move with the range/index contract because the version-one specification currently defines no byte bounds or slice result contract;
- explicit `bytes`, `scalars`, and `graphemes` string views without changing the default grapheme length;
- the pinned Unicode version contract, sourced from the toolchain profile rather than the package lock;
- canonical `utf8`, `utf16-le`, `utf16-be`, `utf32-le`, and `utf32-be` encoding objects, with encoding total and decoding raising a typed `decode-error` carrying encoding and byte offset;
- prevention of arbitrary bytes reaching `print` through a blanket display implementation.

Exit criterion: a round-trip encode/decode case runs, an invalid byte sequence produces the typed decode error at its offset, and view lengths differ correctly for a multi-scalar grapheme.
Implemented evidence: bytes literals preserve arbitrary byte values, expose byte length,
iterate as `uint8`, and deliberately lack scalar display. Explicit UTF-8 byte, scalar, and
grapheme views produce distinct counts for one multi-scalar grapheme. Compiler-owned
UTF-8, UTF-16 little-/big-endian, and UTF-32 little-/big-endian encoding objects all
round-trip through generated crates, while invalid input exits through the typed
`decode-error` value with its observed byte offset. Unicode behavior currently comes from
the three support-crate dependencies selected by Cargo; no compiler toolchain profile pins
one Unicode data version across them yet, so that milestone-11 deliverable remains open.
Byte indexing and slicing remain sequenced with the range/index contract rather than
acquiring an implementation-defined bounds policy here.


### Milestone 12 — String transformation and search families

Deliver:

- the `trim` family with `start` and `end` children, where a child with no argument removes the whitespace run and a child with a literal removes that literal when present;
- the `contains` family with `start` and `end` children, all boolean, plus the separate `find` family returning `text-range|none` with `find.all` and `find.count`;
- `upper` and `lower` with their specified children, `normalise.nfc/nfd/nfkc/nfkd`, and locale-independent `case-fold` as explicitly named Unicode operations;
- literal `split` and `replace` with the settled empty-pattern and non-overlapping-advance rules;
- `text-range` with checked byte, scalar, and grapheme views over an immutable input.

Exit criterion: the specified empty-pattern, position-child, and Unicode-property behaviors each have cases, including a right-to-left sample proving the position children act on logical order.
Implemented evidence: trim and logical position children, non-overlapping find/count and
replace, normalization, full Unicode case folding, explicit case operations, and split
lower through compiler-owned typed calls into the pinned text runtime. Runtime conformance
covers a decomposed normalization sample, right-to-left start/end behavior, and every
empty-pattern grapheme-boundary rule: `find.all` includes both ends, `split` emits the
graphemes without synthetic empties, and `replace` inserts at each boundary. Text ranges
retain immutable source text and expose byte, scalar, and grapheme boundary views.


### Milestone 13 — Iterator protocol

Deliver:

- `iteration-step of Item` with `item of Item` and `end` alternatives as the advancing result;
- stateful linear iterators with sticky `end` that do not consult the source after exhaustion;
- `for` desugared through the protocol without exposing or synthesising sentinel values;
- iterator state and item typing settled before any collection depends on them.

Exit criterion: a user-defined iterator drives `for` through the same path as the built-in string iteration, and an iterator yielding `none` as a legitimate item is distinguished from exhaustion.

Implemented evidence (partial; the exit criterion remains open): `iteration-step` is a
compiler-owned typed result with distinct `item` and sticky `end` alternatives. Compiler-owned
`iterator` values, strings, bytes, ranges, and every collection enter `for` through the same
`Iterable::terrane_iterator` / `Iterator::next` support protocol; conformance distinguishes a
yielded `none` from exhaustion and advances again after exhaustion. Source-defined iterator
objects are not implemented yet, so the required user-defined iterator case does not pass.

### Milestone 14 — Collections and value semantics

Collections are the first non-scalar mutable value type, so the value-semantics half of ownership
lands here rather than being retrofitted after the types that need it. References, provenance, and
borrow analysis remain milestone 17; linear resources arrive with the first real resources in
milestone 20.

Deliver:

- list, map, set, tuple, range, and entry types under `/core/collections`, populating the empty compiler-owned namespace reserved since milestone 3 and adding each collection vertically rather than as one batch;
- lookup and indexing whose default child throws `missing-key` or `index-error` and whose `checked` child returns absence, with no operation returning absence by default;
- insertion-ordered map and set as the observable contract, plus a separate unordered type that is deterministic under a fixed hash seed rather than merely unordered;
- half-open ranges with an explicit inclusive constructor, non-zero step, and empty-range rules;
- semantic value assignment for ordinary values, so a value handed to another binding is independent of its source without requiring a physical copy the compiler can prove is unnecessary;
- copy-on-write separation at the first mutation visible through a non-unique handle, with mutable and identity-bearing values rejected as hash keys;
- the deterministic drop pipeline, since a collection is the first value whose release point is observable;
- identity metadata on type contracts, with source `is` never derived from Rust pointer identity.

Exit criterion: each collection has parsing, inference, mutation, lowering, and execution evidence; ordering is observable and reproducible across runs for both ordered and unordered variants; and value assignment, separation, and drop order are each observable through a collection rather than asserted in the abstract.

Implemented evidence (partial; the exit criterion remains open): the compiler-owned collection
descriptors construct statically typed copy-on-write lists, insertion-ordered maps and sets,
homogeneous fixed-length tuples, ranges, entries, and separately named unordered maps and sets
using a deterministic fixed-seed hash implementation. Applied `tuple of Item` types cross binding,
parameter, and return boundaries; tuple runtime length is not part of the type. Conformance
covers member and indexed mutation, checked and throwing lookup with typed `index-error` /
`missing-key`, ordered and unordered iteration, typed `key, value` destructuring of map entries,
range direction and inclusivity, homogeneous-item rejection, and assignment separation.
Collection drop order is not yet source-observable, and collection identity metadata plus source
`is` behavior are not implemented; those parts of the exit criterion remain outstanding.

### Milestone 15 — Function values and closures

Deliver:

- first-class function values and closures over the callable protocol established in milestone 8;
- storable bound method families, lifting the version-one restriction diagnosed since milestone 4.5;
- caller-supplied conversion callbacks for pairs no descriptor declares;
- capture semantics defined against the ownership rules, with no implicit boxing of statically known callables.

Exit criterion: a selected method family can be stored, passed, and invoked; the previously rejected form is accepted with a case proving the receiver still evaluates once.

Implemented evidence (partial; the exit criterion remains open): typed, synchronous function values
cross binding and parameter boundaries; anonymous functions capture resolver-selected outer bindings
once; and stored bound methods capture their receiver once before later invocation. Generated Rust
uses statically typed `Arc<dyn Fn>` values rather than a universal runtime value and compiles
receiver-free methods without lint suppression. Conformance executes a passed closure,
distinguishes parameter shadowing from an outer capture, and invokes a stored receiver-bound method.
Caller-supplied pair conversion callbacks are not implemented.

### Milestone 16 — Classes, interfaces, and traits

Deliver:

- class declaration, instance and static fields and methods, explicit `instance class; arguments`
  construction through `construct`, `.` instance selection, `::` static selection, late-bound
  `self`, destruction through `destruct`, and deterministic drop;
- single class inheritance preserving complete subclass state;
- structural named interfaces and non-type traits with explicit conflict resolution;
- dispatch and compatibility over the descriptor model rather than a parallel class table.

Exit criterion: each of construction, inheritance, interface conformance, and trait reuse has an executable slice; dynamic-object state is preserved end to end.

Implemented evidence (partial; the exit criterion remains open): source classes lower typed instance
and static fields and methods; construction is explicit through `instance class; arguments`, with
bare class invocation rejected; `.` and `::` are distinct syntax and semantic paths that reject the
opposite member kind; `this` is instance-only; and late-bound `self` supports inherited static
factories and independently stored state for each effective class. Static fields use the same
compiler-owned per-operation synchronization strategy as mutable globals, including nested member
mutation without copy-out. Custom `construct`, one-lineage-per-independent-value `destruct`,
mutating receivers inferred transitively from effective method contracts, immutable methods, and
separated value state are implemented. Ordinary assignment, by-value closure capture, and
interface-typed copies create fresh lifecycle lineages, while compiler-only Rust clones remain
within their originating lineage. Single inheritance of arbitrary depth retains base and subclass
fields, lets methods access flattened storage directly, recursively forwards instance field reads
and writes through generated wrappers, dispatches overridden methods, inherits base interface
conformance, safely widens inherited `this` and static `self` factory returns, and composes
overridden destruction hooks from the most-derived class toward the root base. Declared, nominal
interface conformance lowers through typed protocol wrappers and preserves mutating receiver
requirements inferred from implementations, while traits reuse fields and methods. Executable
cases isolate direct construction and member dispatch, independent instance state, singleton
state, inherited `self` construction, inherited per-effective-class static state, nested static
field mutation, separated state and destruction, inheritance, inherited fields including
ten-level read/write forwarding, interface conformance across inheritance, self-typed returns,
immutable and mutating interface dispatch, trait reuse, and combined
inheritance/interface/lifecycle behavior. Rejected cases cover implicit class invocation,
construction postfixes before the required call marker, missing/non-class construction
designators, non-class static selectors, static-selector whitespace, duplicate or out-of-class
static qualifiers, contextual-name declarations, class-designator shadowing, cross-kind member
selection, `this` in static methods, missing construction punctuation, uninitialized fields,
missing interface methods, incompatible signatures, and unresolved trait conflicts. Structural
conformance and integration with the descriptor model remain outstanding; object analysis
currently uses a compiler-owned parallel contract table.

Construct/destruct contract:

```markdown
Ordinary declared methods with compiler-recognized lifecycle roles. That preserves the object model while still letting the compiler guarantee invocation at the right times.

`construct`

- called only by the explicit `instance class; arguments` operation;
- may take parameters (though it does not have to);
- runs after storage exists but before the instance becomes externally observable;
- if it throws, partially initialized state is cleaned up deterministically.

`destruct`

- zero-argument;
- invoked exactly once for an owned instance when its lifetime ends;
- is not invoked automatically on a value whose ownership was moved away;
- cannot throw in version one, because destruction during an active error path must not replace or obscure that error.

`construct` / `destruct` are ordinary declared methods with compiler-recognized lifecycle roles.
The paired Terrane terminology is retained instead of Rust's `drop`.
```

### Milestone 17 — References and provenance

Value semantics, separation, and drop land with collections in milestone 14; this milestone adds
non-owning observation and explicit shared ownership over them.

Deliver:

- `ref` as the ordinary non-owning reference to an existing owned identity, with compiler-tracked
  provenance and lifetime;
- `shared ref` as the conspicuous operation and type form that shares ownership and extends that
  identity's lifetime;
- `move` as explicit ownership transfer;
- preservation or narrowing of reference provenance through member access, indexing, iteration,
  calls, capture, fields, and other derived values;
- rejection of reference escape and use after the originating owner's lifetime ends, reported at
  the originating binding and lifetime-ending operation;
- rejection of provable `shared ref` ownership cycles, without treating ordinary `ref` back-edges
  as cycles;
- replacement and ordinary rebinding end the lifetime of the previously owned identity: a `ref`
  becomes unusable, while a `shared ref` continues to own the old identity and neither form is
  silently retargeted to the replacement;

Exit criterion: a bounded non-owning reference works without extending its owner's lifetime; escape
and use after release are diagnosed in source terms; a shared owner keeps an identity alive; and
the distinction is proven against the value semantics already exercised by collections.

Implemented evidence (partial; exit criterion remains open): the source interface and typed pipeline
now use non-owning `ref T` and owning `shared ref T`; lowering represents them with synchronized weak
and strong storage respectively. Conformance proves ordinary references to named owned local
bindings, transparent scalar member and consumer access, shared mutation through an owner, bounded
non-owning observation, explicit ownership transfer, temporary and parameter-source rejection,
source-diagnosed return escape, replacement invalidation of non-owning references, and continued
access through shared owners after replacement. The current generated
representation clones the referenced value for each read; this is a correctness-first lowering, not
the intended reference cost model. Async suspension now proves a directly declared local owner that
remains in the task frame without replacement or ownership transfer; broader lifetime analysis,
shared-ownership cycle analysis, complete derived-provenance coverage, and borrow-oriented lowering
remain outstanding.

### Milestone 18 — Callable contracts, errors, and reflection

Deliver:

- exact transitive throwable-set inference for public and private callables, after catch handling and
  `finally` replacement; optional postfix `throws T` is an upper-bound compatibility contract rather
  than required effect narration;
- ordinary user-declared classes implementing `/core/errors::throwable`, with standard errors
  migrated to compiler-owned implementing classes and arbitrary non-throwable values rejected;
- reflection that exposes a callable's optional declared throwable bound separately from its
  inferred escaping throwable set, and reports the retained source-declared callable contracts
  currently represented by `.contracts`;
- descriptor materialisation: reflection is the case that requires a canonical descriptor object
  at runtime, so this milestone supplies what milestone 4.6 deliberately does not. A statically
  resolved descriptor still lowers to nothing; a profile that strips reflection metadata removes
  the materialisation, not the identity;
- retained descriptor identity and public callable/type metadata in ordinary profiles, stripped
  private bodies and unrequested inventories, and a compile-time failure when code requests
  metadata a profile does not retain.

Exit criterion: exact escaping throwable contracts survive catch and `finally`, callable reflection
reports independently meaningful contracts without claiming authority over ordinary operations, and
a minimal profile rejects an unavailable reflection request at compile time.

Implemented evidence: typed escaping throwables are computed from explicit throws, propagated calls,
fallible explicit integer-coercion calls, and fallible implicit numeric destination conversions
after catches and `finally`; checked against optional postfix `throws T` bounds; and exposed
separately from those declared bounds. Standard and user-declared `throwable` implementations share
the structured-error pipeline.
Descriptor values materialise only when observed, and minimal reflection profiles reject unavailable
metadata access. `awaits`, `mutating`, `mutates`, and bare `foreign` have been removed as callable
qualifiers; suspension and receiver mutation are inferred, while foreign transitions belong to
concrete adapter or ABI constructs. Accepted and rejected conformance covers catch/finally throwable
sets, scalar and collection-contained coercion failures propagated across callable boundaries,
custom throwables, incompatible bounds including inferred explicit and implicit coercion failures,
callable-contract reflection, descriptor materialisation, profile denial, stripped reflection, and
rejection of removed qualifiers. This satisfies the milestone exit criterion.

### Milestone 19 — Async core: tasks, scope, cancellation, and deadlines

This milestone precedes the timer, stream, and network milestones because their contracts are defined against it.

Deliver:

- the async callable type, `await`, and task objects, with sync and async callables incompatible without an explicit adapter;
- the structured-concurrency scope: creation, child spawn, join, and defined behavior for a child that throws while siblings run;
- cooperative cancellation with defined cancellation points, reporting completed work rather than silently discarding partial progress;
- deadlines as explicit values that additionally propagate down scope boundaries, where a child may shorten but never extend a parent's deadline;
- the executor boundary the language fixes versus the profile selects, with no hard-coded executor;
- borrow and linear-resource rules across suspension.

Exit criterion: a cancelled scope joins its children and reports partial progress; a nested deadline cannot be extended; and no borrow crosses suspension without a proven lifetime.

Implemented evidence: async callables, postfix `await`, linear task values, task-scope
creation/spawn/join, partial-progress outcome observations, threaded and cooperative executor
profiles, effective-deadline clamping, and suspension ownership checks run through the shared
parser, semantic model, and Rust lowering. Presence comparisons on optional task results lower to
`is_some`/`is_none`, so observing a task result never imposes an equality contract on its value
type. Runtime and dependency inclusion is selected by lowering metadata rather than rendered-source
scanning.

Every lowered Terrane `await` yields to the executor before polling its operand and again after the
operand completes. The cancellable executor checks the scope between those child polls, so even an
immediately-ready awaited future cannot carry execution past the suspension point after cancellation
or deadline expiry. A focused threaded-runtime harness coordinates cancellation while an awaited
future is being polled and proves that the child is dropped before its post-`await` statement, then
joins as cancelled. A failed child retains its typed throwable and requests cancellation through the
scope's shared state, which surviving siblings observe at their next cancellation point. Linear
scoped tasks must be joined before the enclosing function can exit, and join reports completed,
cancelled, value, and typed error state. Child deadlines take the earlier of inherited and requested
deadlines at runtime; statically resolvable extensions are additionally rejected in source.

Accepted and rejected conformance covers async/sync type incompatibility, task consumption,
successful, throwing, cancelled, and sibling-cancelling children, statically resolvable nested
deadline extension, a non-owning reference whose unchanged local owner is proven to remain in the
task frame across suspension, and rejection when a parameter-sourced owner lifetime cannot be
proven.

### Milestone 20 — Byte and text streams and process standard streams

Written in Terrane over the minimal Rust core, per delivery principle 9. Each layer implemented in Rust states which of the four justifications applies; everything above it is Terrane.


Deliver:

- byte reader and writer protocols with partial-operation and EOF contracts;
- text reader and writer adapters carrying explicit encodings and performing no implicit newline translation;
- typed stdin, stdout, and stderr over the same protocols;
- explicit idempotent close with observable close and flush failures, and `flush` distinguished from `sync-data` and `sync-all` on both byte and text writers;
- inferred resource ownership, deferred here from milestone 17 because a stream handle is the first genuinely noncopyable field: the enclosing class becomes resource-owning transitively without a declaration qualifier, assignment and ordinary resource-accepting calls transfer it automatically, release uses the milestone 14 drop pipeline, and use after transfer or release is a compile-time failure rather than a runtime one; the current generated representation uses a host-handle reference count only to coordinate exactly one host release after transfer into an adapter;
- async variants sharing the same contracts with cancellation reported by the enclosing task outcome.

Exit criterion: partial reads and writes, EOF, and use-after-close each have cases; a cancelled stream operation reports what it completed; and a released resource cannot be used again.

Implemented on `byte-text-streams`. Import-driven bundled source infrastructure recursively includes
registered Terrane namespaces only when selected by an ordinary import, preserves every included
source for diagnostics and generated-source associations, and lowers the bundled source beside the
application rather than pre-lowering it. `/core/streams` uses that path for result objects,
inferred resource-owning stream classes, partial/exact/all loops, explicit encoding adapters,
process factories, newline policy, and async wrappers. Rust is limited to the process-I/O
syscall/ABI layer: an
opaque handle registry and one host read, write, flush, durability-sync, or idempotent-close
operation.

Accepted conformance exercises partial reads and writes, explicit EOF including a zero-length read,
distinct exact and bounded-all reads, byte and text resumption from incomplete writes, repeated
resume semantics, byte-exact UTF-8 data, text adaptation without implicit newline translation,
typed standard error, malformed decode failure, distinct flush and sync operations on both writer
adapters, observable idempotent close, and both outcomes of cancellation racing an async stream
operation. Rejected conformance covers resource transfer through assignment, ordinary calls, and
method arguments followed by use, use after close, double close, resource-owning inheritance,
the removed `/core/platform-streams` spelling, and the removed `linear class` declaration
qualifier. Accepted cases compile their generated
crates with warnings denied; canonical-Rust validation is enabled for
the accepted cases that pass untouched structural validation. Milestone evidence:
`cargo test -p terrane-compiler --tests` with `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`, plus piped executions of the
byte, text, decode-failure, and cancelled-operation cases through `terrane run`.

### Milestone 21 — Paths, filesystem, and process facilities

Written in Terrane over the minimal Rust core, per delivery principle 9. Each layer implemented in Rust states which of the four justifications applies; everything above it is Terrane.


Deliver:

- lexical `path` values with platform-neutral components and normalization that resolves `..` lexically without crossing a root;
- the capability-gated `filesystem` object with metadata, symlink metadata, canonicalization, and permissions as a portable subset plus profile detail;
- race-resistant directory-handle-relative traversal with no-follow by default and explicit beneath and cross-filesystem policies;
- file handles as linear resources, bounded whole-file operations, and atomic replacement that renames without following links;
- environment and argument access over a lossless native-string type, the schema-driven CLI parser, and `exit-status` with the `0..=255` code range.

Exit criterion: lexical resolution and filesystem canonicalization are separately observable, a traversal escape attempt is refused, and the CLI parser returns structured diagnostics without calling process exit itself.

Implemented on `filesystem-process-facilities`. Import-driven bundled Terrane packages keep
`/core/filesystem/paths`, `/core/filesystem`, and `/core/process` visible through semantic
analysis and lowering. Rust is limited to host filesystem, descriptor, environment, argument, and
process-exit boundaries. Paths normalize and resolve lexically in Terrane;
`filesystem-canonical` is the distinct native host-resolution operation, with
`filesystem-realpath` retained as its deliberate POSIX spelling alias. The unforgeable
filesystem capability gates metadata, symlink metadata, native resolution, read-link, bounded
reads, atomic replacement, rename, removal, file handles, and directory-relative no-follow
traversal with beneath and cross-filesystem policy. Portable metadata has a structured host result
carrying kind, size, read-only state, platform permission detail, and failure detail; existence
checks likewise preserve lookup failures rather than collapsing them to `false`.

Process facilities expose lossless text-or-raw platform strings, explicit argument and environment
snapshots, a schema-driven parser that returns option names, values, positionals, and structured
diagnostics without terminating, and validated `exit-status` values in `0..=255`. Accepted
conformance distinguishes lexical resolution from canonicalization, rejects a traversal escape,
and executes flush, sync-data, and sync-all against a real file descriptor alongside atomic
replacement and rename; passes text and non-Unicode process arguments; checks parser diagnostics
and invalid exit-status construction; and observes process exit status 7. Compiler-supplied host
operations are public objects in purpose-named `/core` namespaces; bundled packages import those
namespaces explicitly. Runtime templates are split by selected core or standard facility so
stream-only, filesystem-only, and process-only programs emit no unrelated host shims.
Resource-owning collection types are rejected before lowering, and stream operations release the
global registry lock before per-handle blocking I/O. Untouched generated Rust passes
warnings-denied compilation and canonical-Rust validation. Milestone evidence:
`RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo test --workspace --all-targets` and
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

### Milestone 22 — Document values, JSON, YAML, and URLs

Written in Terrane over the minimal Rust core, per delivery principle 9. Each layer implemented in Rust states which of the four justifications applies; everything above it is Terrane.


Deliver:

- the shared document-value model with exact `document-integer` and `document-decimal`, never routed through `float`;
- JSON parse and write with JCS UTF-16 key ordering and escaping, exact duplicate-key rejection,
  and ECMAScript-shaped exact number serialization; exact document numbers deliberately retain
  precision rather than applying RFC 8785's binary64 rounding;
- YAML restricted to a JSON-shaped safe scalar subset with no executable tags and enforced depth,
  size, and alias-expanded-node limits; its safe writer emits JSON, which is valid YAML 1.2;
- descriptor-driven `serializable` and `deserializable` mapping with field names, optional and default fields, unknown-field policy, and full data-path diagnostics;
- parsed `url` values following the pinned WHATWG standard with UTS #46 processing, ordered query entries, and credentials never displayed by default.
- adversarial-key handling for document maps: the core collection contract uses a deterministic
  fixed-seed hash, which is reproducible but not collision-resistant, so parsers must not expose
  untrusted chosen keys to an algorithmically unbounded hash-table path.

Exit criterion: a decode failure reports its document path and expected descriptor; canonical output is byte-identical across runs; a YAML alias bomb is refused by limit.

Status: implemented on the `document-json-yaml-urls` branch. The shared exact document model,
`serializable` / `deserializable` mappings, live exact integer and decimal constructors, JSON/YAML
policy, and URL/query objects are bundled Terrane sources selected by imports and remain Terrane
until application lowering. Rust owns opaque parser/URL result ABIs, externally reviewed scanners
and WHATWG URL machinery, and the YAML event-stream policy that must reject tags, duplicate keys,
excessive depth, and excessive alias-expanded nodes before materialization. Each boundary module
records its delivery-principle justification. JSON refuses requested depth above 512 and YAML
refuses requested depth above `yaml-rust2`'s reachable limit of 255, so both report Terrane resource
diagnostics instead of leaking parser-library limits. Accepted conformance covers exact and
kind-stable JSON/YAML numbers, unconditional duplicate-key rejection, deterministic JCS key
ordering with exact number serialization, serializing and deserializing descriptor interfaces,
document paths and unknown fields, JSON/YAML depth and size limits, YAML alias-node limits and safe
scalar behavior, URL credential-safe display, duplicate ordered query entries, relative resolution,
and generated-Rust compilation and execution with warnings denied. Rejection cases prove that the
old `/core/documents/json::platform-parse` implementation spelling is not exported.

### Milestone 23 — Randomness, codecs, digests, and compression

Written in Terrane over the minimal Rust core, per delivery principle 9. Each layer implemented in Rust states which of the four justifications applies; everything above it is Terrane.


Deliver:

- incompatible `secure-random` and `pseudo-random of Algorithm` types, with rejection sampling for bounded generation;
- SHA-256 and SHA-512 digests and HMAC, with secret buffers, best-effort zeroisation, and constant-time digest comparison;
- strict hex and distinct standard and URL-safe base64 codecs with explicit padding policy;
- UUID parsing plus v4 and v7 generation;
- `gzip`, `zlib`, `deflate-raw`, and `zstd` codecs with no auto-detect default, deterministic mode, and mandatory output, ratio, and work limits on decompression.

Exit criterion: a pseudo-random source cannot satisfy a secure-random parameter; a decompression bomb is refused with a distinct resource-limit error rather than truncated success.

Implemented on `randomness-networking-tls`. Import-driven bundled Terrane packages retain the
public random-source, explicitly selected pseudo-random algorithm, secret-buffer, distinct digest
and signature values, codec, UUID, and compression policy until application lowering. Secret
buffers support explicit destruction as well as best-effort zeroisation on final release. One
generated support crate supplies only operating-system entropy, opaque capability storage,
constant-time/zeroising primitives, and audited codec/compression implementations. Accepted
execution covers deterministic ChaCha20 generation and splitting, secure and bounded generation,
SHA-256 and SHA-512 digests and HMAC, destroyed-key and unsupported-algorithm failures, strict codec
padding policies, UUID parsing and v4/v7 generation, all four compression formats, explicit
single-layer decompression, and distinct limit refusal. Rejected cases prove that pseudo-random
values cannot satisfy secure-random parameters and that core tools remain unavailable until their
owning namespace or object is imported.


### Milestone 24 — Networking and TLS

Written in Terrane over the minimal Rust core, per delivery principle 9. Each layer implemented in Rust states which of the four justifications applies; everything above it is Terrane.


Deliver:

- parsed `ip-address`, `socket-address`, and a distinct `network-host-name` type, serialising IPv6 per RFC 5952;
- `tcp-listener`, `tcp-stream`, and `udp-socket` type objects owning their factories and returning distinct linear resource instances;
- explicit `dns` lookup returning ordered candidates with TTL, leaving caching to an explicit resolver and connection racing to `connect`;
- deadline and cancellation on every blocking operation, typed socket options, and explicit UDP truncation reporting;
- TLS over the shared stream protocol, defaulting to TLS 1.3 with supported 1.2, performing chain and hostname validation, with any insecure connector requiring a separately imported unsafe capability and remaining visibly typed as insecure.

Exit criterion: a loopback client and server exchange data under a deadline; certificate validation cannot be disabled through an ordinary option; a truncated datagram is reported rather than silently shortened.

Implemented on `randomness-networking-tls`. Bundled Terrane packages own validated address and host
values, typed socket options, shared cancellation tokens, positive per-operation deadlines, and
structured results. Generated host support owns only DNS and socket/TLS resources crossing the OS
and audited-protocol boundaries. TCP host connection races ordered DNS candidates concurrently; DNS
returns candidates in a deterministic address sort rather than resolver preference order, includes
TTL, and is itself deadline- and cancellation-aware. TCP, UDP, DNS, and TLS operations carry the
same observable cancellation capability and deadline contract; the distinct resource-owning TCP
and TLS stream types expose the same read/write/close method shape, and UDP receive results preserve
truncation. TLS consumes the TCP resource during upgrade, applies each operation's deadline, uses
the bundled Mozilla root set, validates certificate chains and host names, negotiates TLS 1.3 or
supported TLS 1.2, sends close-notify on explicit shutdown, and exposes no ordinary option for
disabling validation. Host-boundary tests exercise deadline-bounded loopback TCP exchange,
concurrent accepts without listener-lock serialization, UDP truncation, deterministic DNS candidate
ordering and TTL projection, trusted local TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2 negotiation, close-notify, and local
untrusted-certificate validation failure. Accepted Terrane cases exercise address and host parsing,
cancellation, socket options, loopback TCP and UDP exchange, and resource-producing factories.

### Milestone 25 — Rust dependencies, projection, and editor integration

Design detail, rationale, and the full action list are in `docs/rust-deps.md`; this milestone is
its delivery contract. Terrane lowers to Rust, so generated code calling a dependency is Rust calling
Rust inside one crate. There is no adapter layer and no marshalling: the boundary is exactly the set
of places where a guarantee Terrane makes does not hold on the crate's side.

Nothing in this milestone may be crate-specific. `reqwest` is the proving case, not the target.

Deliver:

- the governing dependency principle, which this milestone implements for Rust and later milestones
  specialise elsewhere: declarations name ecosystems and packages rather than APIs, the build
  generates only the machinery Terrane source actually crosses, and the surface offered to editors is
  derived from the resolved package rather than owned by the compiler;
- **manifest-only declaration.** The project manifest carries crate, version, features, default-feature
  policy, and target conditions. There is no source-level dependency declaration; `/deps` is a
  reserved root namespace segment, and a `from /deps/...` import naming an undeclared crate is
  a Terrane diagnostic;
- **the projector**, one artifact computed from the lock-resolved package, features, target, and
  rustdoc JSON, consumed by both the compiler and the language server so hints and lowering cannot
  disagree: module paths to namespaces, verbatim third-party names, `async fn` to async, bound-driven
  monomorphisation where a bound has a closed impl set, inherent methods as members, trait methods
  into the trait's own namespace as receiver-first functions, data-free and data-carrying enums as
  opaque values, and a recorded reason for every item it declines to project;
- **boundary lowering.** A general foreign value type keyed by crate and Rust path, replacing the
  per-support-crate platform value types; generated shims for crossed members only; `Result<T, E>` as a
  return of `T` under a `throws` contract naming the projected error class, and `Option<T>` as
  `T|none`; receivers projected faithfully, with `&self` as a shared receiver, `&mut self` recorded as
  receiver mutability on the projected contract, and `self` requiring `move` under the existing
  foreign-resource rule. Mutable receivers use ordinary Terrane member-call syntax; the contract
  drives mutable binding and borrowing in generated Rust. Panic is contained at the crossing and
  converted to `dependency-panic` on unwinding profiles, and not contained on aborting profiles;
- **diagnostics in Terrane terms** for moves, drops, `Send`/`Sync` at task boundaries, and escaping
  borrows, per the existing translation contract. A removed crossed member is diagnosed as missing at
  its Terrane import or use site rather than surfacing as a rustc error against generated source;
  distinguishing removal from a never-present member and naming the lock version change is deferred
  until projection history has a durable, machine-independent home;
- **capability and containment.** The manifest declaration is the grant, transitively, with the build
  report identifying what executed; a profile forbidding an effect rejects the dependency at manifest
  resolution rather than at a call site. Builds fetch online and then compile `--offline --frozen`
  with the filesystem scoped to project, cargo home, and target, and no process execution outside the
  toolchain, with an allowlist tier for crates needing system discovery. Containment is at the cargo
  invocation, since proc macros expand inside rustc, and a platform that cannot enforce it says so.
  The projection pass runs under the same capability and the same policy as a build script;
- **cache identity and retention** covering manifest, lock checksum, features, default-feature policy,
  target triple, toolchain version, package source checksums, and sandbox tier, so a build that reached
  further is not cache-equivalent to one that did not. The project-local cache retains the current
  projection plus at most three prior artifacts for ordinary rollback and editor churn; this bounded
  operational history is not the durable, machine-independent history required by the deferred
  version-aware diagnostics;
- **the specification amendments this requires**, which are language changes and not editorial: making
  uppercase and underscore legal identifier characters so verbatim projected names are writable, with
  kebab-case kept mandatory for compiler-owned and standard-library names and every documentation
  example and available as an opt-in lint elsewhere; removing the tooling-execution prohibition from
  Rust inspection because it is compilation; removing the source-level dependency declaration form;
  adding `dependency-panic` to the standard throwables; and confirming
  the foreign-resource ownership rule covers Rust values;
- **language-server integration** rendering the projector's model for completion, signature help, and
  hover, showing the verbatim Rust path and the recorded reason for declined items, advisory
  throughout with Cargo and rustc the authority on what compiles.

Exit criterion: a warning-free local loopback `reqwest` build and run, using `default-features = false`
with explicit `blocking` and `rustls-tls` and a chosen roots variant, called from Terrane through the
projection with no authored wrapper; **and a second, deliberately dissimilar crate** — synchronous,
non-network, data-shaped, a different API idiom — projected and called through the same machinery with
no special casing, since one witness cannot distinguish a general rule from a tuned one. Accepted and
rejected dependency fixtures, lock and feature mismatch diagnostics, deterministic generated Cargo and
Rust goldens, and conformance cases for an uppercase identifier, an underscored identifier, and a
verbatim projected name. External-network tests do not prove the contract.

Implemented on `rust-dependency-projection`. Manifest-declared Rust packages resolve through one
lock-derived rustdoc projection shared by compilation and editor tooling. The compiler projects
verbatim functions, inherent methods, receiver ownership, opaque foreign values, enums, and
`Result`; it records `Option` signatures and trait methods as declined until general `T|none`
semantic types and receiver-first trait namespaces arrive in milestone 25.2. It generates only
crossed shims, pins generated Cargo dependencies to the projected versions, and translates dependency
failures and unwinding panics into distinct Terrane throwable completion. A projected mutable-borrow
method makes the receiver binding mutable; while object identity remains name-only, conflicting
receiver contracts on same-named projected types are rejected as `S2030` rather than selected by
import or artifact order. Rust dependency projection requires the Linux `bwrap` containment tier and fails explicitly
when it is unavailable; dependency-free programs do not probe containment, rustdoc, or the pinned
nightly toolchain. Wiring projection itself to a build-capability grant, rejecting dependency effects
forbidden by a selected profile, distinguishing unwinding from aborting profiles, containing
generated-crate compilation, and retaining durable projection history for version-naming
removed-member diagnostics remain explicit follow-on capability requirements, staged in milestone
25.2.
Accepted execution covers a loopback `reqwest` request and the dissimilar `httpdate` crate through
the same machinery, including caught dependency errors, a fixture-owned generated-Rust panic
boundary preserving payload and crate/member context, uppercase and underscored identifiers, and
verbatim projected names. Package tests cover aliasing, selected features, and loopback execution;
generated Rust and Cargo output remain deterministic and warning free. Target-specific dependency
tables, recorded projection declines, and asynchronous namespace-aware completion, hover, and
signature help cover the corresponding resolution and editor contracts.

Four small items are carried out of milestone 25 rather than blocking it. None changes an observable
contract, and each is cheap to take whenever its file is next open:

- **`cargo_manifest_table` is a stringly-typed discriminator.** It returns a `String`, and six call
  sites in `terrane-cli/src/main.rs`, `terrane-compiler/src/projection.rs`, and
  `terrane-compiler/tests/conformance.rs` compare it against the literal `"dependencies"` to decide
  whether an entry belongs in the default Cargo table — over information `RustDependency::target`
  already carries as an `Option`. Returning `Option<String>`, with `None` meaning the default table,
  removes all six literals;
- **`selected_target` reads only `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`.** Cache identity distinguishes a
  cross-compiled projection from a host one through that variable, falling back to `rustc -vV`'s
  `host:` line. A target selected by a `--target` argument or by `build.target` in a
  `.cargo/config.toml` is not seen, so two such builds share a cache entry. Narrower than the gap it
  replaced, and worth closing when the build surface next grows a target flag of its own;
- **the language server resolves an imported name by its first matching import line.**
  `imported_dependency_namespace` scans the document for a `from /deps/... import ...` naming the
  symbol, so a name imported from two dependency namespaces in one file resolves to whichever line
  comes first. The surface is advisory and the compiler is unaffected, but hover and signature help
  can name the wrong namespace where completion would not;
- **`S2030` has no conformance case, and the corpus cannot supply one.** No same-named projected type
  pair in any declared crate disagrees on a receiver kind, so the ambiguity is unreachable from source
  and is covered by a semantics test over a synthetic projection instead. If a later dependency makes
  the case reachable, it earns a fixture; until then the absence should be recorded in
  `docs/rust-deps.md` §6.2 the way §6.3 records the equivalent gap for a Terrane-level
  `dependency-panic` catch.

### Milestone 25.1 — Namespace-qualified object identity

Milestone 3 gave an object type the shape `ValueType::Object(String)`, holding the declared name and
nothing else. Every namespace tier since has been resolved by that bare name, and the whole corpus has
stayed inside packages where names happen not to repeat. Milestone 25 removed that condition: a
projected crate surfaces its own module structure verbatim, and a crate of any size names the same type
in sibling modules. `reqwest` alone projects `Action`, `Body`, `Client`, `ClientBuilder`, `Request`,
`RequestBuilder`, and `Response` into two module namespaces each. Object identity is now
under-determined in ordinary use rather than in a contrived one.

Two shipped behaviours follow from the bare name, and both are wrong in the same way:

- **type identity ignores the namespace.** `value_types_compatible` compares
  `ValueType::Object(expected)` to `ValueType::Object(actual)` by string equality, then resolves
  interfaces and bases with `objects.iter().find(|object| object.name == *actual)`. A
  `/deps/reqwest/blocking::Response` is therefore accepted where `/deps/reqwest/async-impl/response::Response`
  is declared. The program compiles, and the mistake reaches rustc rather than the author;
- **generated Rust names ignore the namespace.** Terrane-declared objects collide because
  `rust_object_name` maps each bare declared name to the same Rust type name (`E0428`), while projected
  foreign types collide because same-named types from sibling namespaces become duplicate re-exports
  in one Rust module scope (`E0252`). Both are failures against generated source — the failure mode
  §29.3 exists to prevent, and the one this milestone's predecessor spent its diagnostic work
  eliminating everywhere else.

Neither is specific to dependency projection. Two Terrane packages, or two namespaces in one package,
declaring the same class name hit the identical pair. Projection is what made it reachable without
trying.

The fix is to make the declaring namespace part of the identity rather than to add ambiguity checks
around a name that cannot carry one.

Deliver:

- **`ValueType::Object` carries the declaring namespace alongside the declared name**, and the pair is
  the identity. The name alone stops being a key anywhere in semantics: construction sites at
  declaration, inference, parameter and return contracts, field types, thrown-type bounds, and the
  bootstrap error objects all supply the namespace that declared the object. `ValueType::Descriptor`
  is the same shape and the same problem; decide whether it moves with this change or is explicitly
  left for a later one, and record which;
- **object equality, interface satisfaction, and base-chain resolution keyed on the qualified
  identity.** `value_types_compatible`'s object arm compares both halves, and its `objects` lookup
  finds the object declared by that namespace rather than the first with a matching name. The same
  applies to every other `objects.iter().find(|object| object.name == …)` in the semantic pass;
- **namespace-qualified generated Rust type names.** Two same-named objects in two namespaces emit two
  distinct Rust items. Generated Rust remains a readable debugging surface, so the qualification is
  legible and deterministic rather than a hash: the unqualified name stays where nothing collides, and
  the encoding is stated once rather than discovered per case. Whatever form it takes must survive the
  existing canonical-Rust check;
- **diagnostics that name the short form and qualify only when it is ambiguous.** An author reading
  `expected Response, found Response` learns nothing. When two candidates share a name, the diagnostic
  names both namespaces; when they do not, it stays as it reads today. The type-mismatch,
  interface-satisfaction, and unresolved-type diagnostics all go through this;
- **retire the by-name fallbacks the missing namespace forced.** `Projection::foreign_rust_path`
  currently falls back to a prefix-less search across every dependency, resolved by shortest Rust path;
  `Projection::method_mutability` exists only to reject when same-named projected types disagree; and
  `object_method_mutates` ends in a call to it. With a qualified receiver type all three become
  unnecessary. They are removed rather than left as unreachable paths, and the milestone-25
  `S2030` receiver-mutability diagnostic added in their place is removed with them;
- **the language-document statement of object identity.** §16 describes objects by declared name;
  identity is the namespace-qualified pair, two identically named objects in two namespaces are two
  types, and no aliasing or structural rule relates them. `docs/language-spec-concise.md` and
  `docs/surface-today.md` follow in the same work unit.

Exit criterion: two namespaces in one package declare a class of the same name; both are usable, a
value of one is rejected where the other is declared, and the diagnostic names both namespaces. Two
same-named types projected from sibling modules of one crate — the `reqwest` `Response` pair is the
witness already in the corpus — are simultaneously imported, both crossed, and the generated crate
compiles warning-free with two distinct Rust types. Accepted and rejected conformance cases cover the
Terrane-declared pair and the projected pair, and no case relies on a package whose object names
happen to be unique.

Delivered on `namespace-qualified-object-identity`. `ValueType::Object` and object contracts now carry
the declaring namespace and declared name as one identity through resolution, compatibility,
inheritance, projected receiver lookup, diagnostics, and lowering. `ValueType::Descriptor` remains
unchanged: descriptors already resolve to canonical compiler-owned identities, so two imported
spellings intentionally denote the same descriptor rather than namespace-local declarations.
Generated Rust retains the short type name when unique; collisions use
`TerraneNs<segment-byte-length><Segment>...<Type>`, a deterministic CamelCase encoding that remains
warning-free under canonical Rust validation. Conformance cases cover accepted and rejected
Terrane-declared collisions, inherited `this` return lowering across a colliding type name, imported
methods on aliased classes, canonical projected-source re-export resolution, and authored function
boundaries carrying both the async and blocking `reqwest::Response` types.

### Milestone 25.2 — Deferred projection surface and dependency capability

Milestone 25 delivered a projection that declines more than it admits, deliberately: every construct it
could not represent is recorded with a reason that reaches the author as `S2029` rather than as a rustc
error. `docs/rust-deps.md` records each decision beside the design it defers. This milestone is where
those deferrals are staged, so a decline recorded in a working note has a milestone that removes it
rather than remaining a permanent shape of the language.

Nothing here reopens a settled decision. The designs in §6.3, §7.3, and §7.4 of `docs/rust-deps.md`
stand as written; what they lack is a delivery point.

Deliver:

- **`Option<T>` as `T|none` for projected values.** The projector currently declines every `Option`
  parameter and result because the semantic model has optional variants only for selected built-in
  value families, not arbitrary foreign objects. Generalising that union to a foreign object type is
  the prerequisite, and it is a language change rather than a projector change. The decline reason and
  its `docs/rust-deps.md` §7.4 note are removed with it;
- **receiver-first trait namespaces.** Trait methods are declined today with an explicit deferral
  reason. §7.3 specifies the form: a trait method projects into the trait's own canonical namespace as
  a free function taking the receiver first, so two traits are two namespaces and a collision is not
  representable, and choosing between them is an import rather than a heuristic. Delivering it retires
  both the decline and the merged-inherent alternative that was rejected;
- **enum variants, constants, and comparison.** Projected enums are opaque values today. §7.4 asks for
  data-free enums to carry projected constants and comparison, and data-carrying enums to expose
  whatever accessors the crate provides, with no destructuring form offered until general pattern
  matching exists;
- **a wider representable primitive and alias set.** `project_type` admits `bool`, `i64`, `f64`, `str`,
  and unit, and declines everything else rather than narrowing silently. The remaining integer widths,
  `f32`, and `char` want edge coercion with an explicit contract at the boundary, matching the rule the
  hand-written support crates already follow. Type aliases resolve only when rustdoc supplies a
  concrete directly representable target; the unresolved cases are declined and want the same
  treatment;
- **the build-capability grant and profile-based rejection.** §23.1 and `docs/rust-deps.md` A6a require
  the projection pass to run under the same explicit build capability as a build script, and §8
  requires a profile forbidding an effect to reject the dependency at manifest resolution rather than
  at a call site. Neither exists: `dependency_projection` runs unconditionally from `analyze`, and
  nothing reads a profile. Milestone 26 applies the shared capability model to the remaining standard
  and system facilities; this milestone owns the dependency-side half, and the two must agree on one
  model rather than growing two;
- **containment of the generated-crate build, and a tier for platforms without `bwrap`.** Today only
  the rustdoc pass is contained, and it is contained by requiring Linux bubblewrap outright — so
  `[rust-dependencies]` is unusable on macOS, on Windows, and on any Linux without it. Both halves are
  wrong in the same direction: the pass that matters most is uncontained, and the pass that is
  contained refuses rather than degrading. §8.1 already states the rule — a platform that cannot
  enforce containment says so — which is a declaration, not a refusal;
- **profile-aware panic containment and a proven unwind-safety boundary.** §6.3 defers both: unwinding
  profiles contain a crossing panic and convert it to `dependency-panic`, aborting profiles do not
  claim containment, and the blanket `AssertUnwindSafe` at every crossing is replaced by a stated
  contract. Build profiles must be represented by the compiler before either is expressible;
- **unrepresented residual foreign imports.** A foreign type that has no projected item still enters a
  generated dependency unit as a direct Rust re-export. Before widening the representable type surface,
  those imports must use their computed aliases so same-named residual types cannot collide in the
  generated root scope. Canonical-path deduplication remains required for repeated re-exports;
- **durable projection history.** A lock update that removes a crossed member is diagnosed as a missing
  member today. §9 defers distinguishing that from a member that never existed, and naming the version
  change, until projection history has a durable, machine-independent home. The project-local cache is
  not that home, and §23.8 says so.

Exit criterion: a crate whose public surface uses `Option`, trait methods, a data-free enum, and an
integer width outside the current set is projected and called from Terrane with no decline for those
constructs, and the corresponding `docs/rust-deps.md` deferral notes are removed rather than reworded.
A profile forbidding an effect rejects its dependency at manifest resolution with a Terrane diagnostic
naming the profile and the effect. The generated crate builds contained on a platform that can enforce
it and reports the tier it used on one that cannot, rather than refusing. A lock update that removes a
crossed member names the member and the version change.

Implemented evidence: arbitrary foreign-object optionals are semantic values and lower recursively;
receiver-first trait methods, data-free enum variants, wider primitives, `char`, and transparent
concrete aliases are projected without narrowing. `[profile]` and dependency `effects` are validated
at manifest load; abort profiles omit unwind conversion and configure generated Cargo accordingly.
Receiver crossings retain an explicit logical-invariant unwind assertion while receiver-free
crossings use Rust's `UnwindSafe` proof. Rustdoc and generated-crate compilation run offline/frozen
inside `bwrap` where available, with the unavailable host tier reported instead of rejected.
`terrane-projection.lock` provides deterministic machine-independent history and `S2031` names a
removed member and its resolved version transition. The accepted
`rust-dependency-deferred-surface` execution case crosses a `bytes` receiver-first trait method and
uses `serde_json`'s `Option<Number>`, `u128` edge coercion, data-free enum variants, and enum
comparison; focused package, projection, semantic, generated-Rust, and rejection checks cover the
remaining contracts.

### Milestone 25.3 — Complete foundational floating-point surface

The first vertical slice of foundational floating-point mathematics establishes `square-root`,
`sine`, `cosine`, `sine-cosine`, `natural-log`, and `exponential` as scalar language members.
This milestone completes that same non-scientific surface; it does not add special functions,
probability distributions, linear algebra, or array mathematics.

Implemented foundation: both floating widths expose those six zero-argument methods, preserve
their receiver precision, and lower to Rust primitive operations without a scientific dependency.
`foundational-float-math` covers both widths, bound-method selection, explicit zero-argument
invocation, the two-result `sine-cosine` shape, and representative NaN, signed-zero, and infinity
behavior; focused rejection cases cover receiver and method arity. Its reviewed lowering is
canonical and executes warning-free.

Implemented increment: both widths additionally expose the `absolute` zero-argument method,
`finite`, `infinite`, and `not-a-number` classification properties, plus same-width `minimum`,
`maximum`, and fused `multiply-add` operations. Their generated Rust is direct primitive scalar
code. The foundational conformance case covers both widths, bound member values, IEEE edge cases,
and fused-versus-unfused rounding; focused rejection cases cover operation arity, argument type,
and attempted invocation of a non-callable property. Its generated crate is canonical,
warning-free, and executable. The pure-Terrane gamma scientific benchmark uses `absolute` and
`multiply-add` in its hot numerical path; the paired Bessel and gamma workloads pass the shared
scientific-stack correctness contracts without importing a scientific mathematics package.

Deliver:

- remaining roots and powers: cube root, hypotenuse, floating power, and integer-exponent power;
- remaining exponentials and logarithms: base-two exponential, near-zero exponential-minus-one,
  near-one natural logarithm, and base-two, base-ten, and arbitrary-base logarithms;
- remaining trigonometry: tangent, inverse sine/cosine/tangent, and two-argument arctangent;
- remaining scalar utilities: copied sign, sign-bit query, clamp, and fractional-part extraction;
- remaining IEEE classification: zero, normal, and subnormal;
- numerical-algorithm utilities: next representable value upward and downward, mantissa/exponent
  decomposition, and exact scaling by an integral power of two;
- descriptor constants for radix, significand precision, epsilon, minimum positive normal and
  subnormal values, and finite minimum and maximum;
- settled contracts for NaN selection, signed zero, infinity, domain behavior, overflow,
  underflow, rounding, accuracy bounds, and target reproducibility for every delivered member.

Exit criterion: accepted conformance cases exercise every member on both `float32` and `float64`,
including representative IEEE boundary values; rejected cases prove receiver type, method/property
selection, zero-argument invocation, arity, and argument contracts. Generated Rust uses direct target operations or compiler-owned scalar
support, compiles warning-free, and execution matches the documented source contract without a
scientific dependency.

### Milestone 26 — Remaining concurrency and system adapters

Milestone 25.2 already established the package `[profile]` model, validates declared dependency
effects against it, and gives projected Rust crossings explicit receiver, error, and panic contracts.
This milestone applies that shared capability model to the remaining standard and system surfaces;
it does not reopen the dependency-projection contracts or the explicitly deferred embedded targets.

Deliver:

- channels, mutexes, read/write locks, atomics, and thread-local objects as library objects over the milestone 19 core;
  These objects synchronise tasks or host threads supplied by the milestone 19 executor/runtime
  boundary; they do not add thread creation, joining, grouping, affinity, or system lifecycle;
- capability enforcement for standard and system facilities under the existing package profile;
- the remaining authored Rust and system adapters, excluding dependency-projection crossings already
  delivered by milestone 25.2, with explicit ABI, lifetime, ownership, and error-translation contracts.

Exit criterion: each new surface enters under the selected capability profile with typed objects and
explicit operational contracts, deterministic lowering, and compiled and run evidence. A forbidden
standard or system capability is rejected with a Terrane diagnostic. No surface is represented as an
empty compiler-owned name to make the map look complete.

Implemented evidence: `/core/concurrency` provides zero-or-positive-capacity integer channels,
integer mutex and read/write-lock cells, typed `atomic-int64` memory ordering, and per-existing-host-
thread local integers over opaque shared host identities. Blocking channel send and receive carry
explicit positive deadlines and cancellation tokens; `try-receive` is non-blocking. Generated Rust
delegates synchronization and defensive operation-specific ordering validation to the support crate
without exposing host handles. This is the host-synchronization ABI boundary permitted by delivery
principle 9: `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver` is not shareable across threads, so the maintained layer
uses `crossbeam-channel` for bounded parking sends and receives plus a genuinely non-blocking probe
without a receiver mutex. Terrane retains the object model, deadline and cancellation policy, and
error translation above that boundary. Explicit channel closure, arbitrary guard-scoped critical
sections, and non-integer generic cells remain deferred rather than being implied by these names.

Bundled core imports are checked against `[profile]`; `S2032` names the profile, forbidden
capability, imported namespace, and importing namespace. The complete gate map is recorded in the
language specification and concise reference. `/core/process::process-host-name` demonstrates the
remaining owned system crossing: its host ABI returns no borrowed value or handle, translates host failures,
and preserves non-Unicode platform names in the existing `native-string` representation. Rust's
standard library has no portable host-name query, so its maintained layer uses the audited
`hostname` crate only for host retrieval and non-Unicode OS-string conversion.
Accepted canonical-Rust package cases compile and run both restricted-profile surfaces, focused
rejected cases prove both gates and message metadata, and support tests exercise rendezvous channels
through a Terrane task, cancellation/deadlines, cross-thread shared state, every atomic ordering
class, and thread-local isolation plus stale-owner cleanup.

### Milestone 26.1 — Structured error sites and compact values

Deliver:

- compiler-owned, deterministic per-program `TerraneSite` allocation with logical-file,
  enclosing-callable, and exact source-range tables;
- readable generated-Rust comments at every site use and table row, preserved by canonical-Rust
  formatting;
- a 16-byte error header containing kind, immutable origin, and optional boxed detail, with lazy
  built-in messages and detail allocation only for message, cause, or propagation frames;
- type-distinct helpers for fresh failure attribution and existing-error propagation;
- namespace-qualified descriptor identity for user throwables and dependency failures;
- accepted runtime coverage for origin/frame ordering and same-name cross-namespace catch identity,
  plus existing rejected throwable-contract coverage and compile-time representation assertions;
- rejection of tagged-pointer packing until binary size is a hard target constraint or profiling
  shows that its changed calling convention matters.

Exit criterion: every accepted throwing program compiles with warnings denied; fresh built-in
failures resolve to the exact raising range without allocating frame storage; propagation retains
that origin and appends caller frames in order; custom catches match semantic descriptor identity;
and an alignment-controlled before/after sci-maths run shows no unexplained runtime change.

Implemented evidence: generated Rust carries dense site tables with logical paths and range ends,
uses site comments that survive canonical formatting, and compile-time asserts both
`TerraneError` and `Result<i64, TerraneError>` at 16 bytes on the supported x86-64 target. The
`structured-error-origin-and-frames`, `uncaught-detailed-coercion`, and
`namespace-qualified-throwable-identity` exercise table-based rendering, preservation of structured
built-in detail, propagation order, and distinct same-name throwable descriptors.
The follow-up `structured-legacy-failures` case closes the remaining legacy failure path: implicit
fixed-width and float narrowing, including conversion at callable arguments, unbounded-integer
division, and float-to-integer rounding are catchable at their raising callable and propagate
through the same structured site helpers. Effect inference derives failures from destination
contexts rather than only explicit `.coerce` syntax. Generated run fixtures contain no
`unwrap_or_fail` emissions; uncaught legacy cases now render their exact raising range.
Tier 3 remains deliberately unimplemented: its generated `unsafe`, manual ownership, and custom
trait implementations are not justified by the measured code-size benefit alone.
The required sci-maths validation used
`-C llvm-args=-align-all-nofallthru-blocks=6` for both compilers, two warmups, and seven measured
runs. A first baseline-then-implementation sequence showed an apparent 6.2–12.5% improvement;
repeating the baseline after the implementation reduced the comparison to -3.7–+1.0%, with every
before/after range overlapping. The reversed control therefore identifies the first result as
ordering/environment noise, not a performance benefit of this work.

### Milestone 27 — Structured logging

Written in Terrane over the minimal Rust core, per delivery principle 9. Each layer implemented in Rust states which of the four justifications applies; everything above it is Terrane.


Deliver:

- an imported, capability-gated `logging` package with named and default loggers and `debug`, `info`, `warning`, and `error` operations;
- immutable field and context enrichment, with fields retaining keys, values, source context, and severity rather than being flattened to text;
- an explicit `log-value` protocol, descriptor-driven redaction, and dot-separated logger hierarchies with filtering before expensive rendering;
- host- or profile-supplied sinks, bounded buffers with an explicit backpressure policy, and a fallback diagnostic sink that does not recursively log;
- an in-memory deterministic test sink with logical sequence numbers and controlled timestamps.

Exit criterion: structured fields survive to the sink unflattened, a secret-typed field is redacted by policy, and captured test output is byte-identical across runs.

### Milestone 28 — First-version hardening and release gate

Deliver:

- complete CLI help and documented exit codes, including a stable distinct code for uncaught source-language runtime failures;
- stable build-directory and cache behavior;
- interruption and subprocess cleanup;
- Windows/macOS/Linux path handling where CI is available;
- deterministic tests and generated artifacts;
- parser/lexer fuzz targets seeded from conformance cases;
- performance baselines for cold check, warm check, build, and run;
- compiler self-diagnostics for unsupported draft features;
- a release manifest listing the exact implemented language subset;
- runnable `examples/` that all compile in CI;
- no test or release command that treats `demos/` as supported source.

Exit criterion: the clean-checkout release scenario below passes on supported platforms and the implemented-subset document agrees with executable conformance tests.

## 8. Clean-checkout release scenario

The release pipeline must prove, from a clean checkout:

1. build the Rust compiler workspace;
2. report `terrane --version`;
3. run unit and conformance tests;
4. verify rejected fixtures and diagnostic goldens;
5. compile every accepted compile fixture with Cargo;
6. execute every run fixture and compare exact stdout, stderr, and exit code;
7. build every file under `examples/`;
8. run `terrane rust` twice for selected cases and compare generated artifacts byte-for-byte;
9. verify no test enumerated, parsed, or built anything under `demos/`;
10. package the `terrane` executable and install that artifact into a second clean environment;
11. compile and run `examples/build-report.trn` using only the installed artifact and Rust toolchain prerequisites.

## 9. Initial feature boundary

### Required in first version

- UTF-8, indentation, all three comment forms, exact spans, and legal empty blocks;
- exact ASCII-only version-one identifier character/joiner policy, spacing-sensitive operators, prefix negation, postfix `++`/`--`, and layered angle-generic rejection;
- normative §34 precedence, associativity, non-associative comparisons, call-free arguments, explicit semicolon calls, and grouping rules;
- a minimal package manifest, manifest-enumerated source units, implicit single-file package identity, namespace declarations, and the fixed version-one bootstrap module table;
- ordinary/object-form lexical lookup distinction, collision/idempotent-import rules, and structural imports unaffected by ordinary bindings;
- locals, namespace bindings, visibility, explicit `global` bindings, definite assignment, and the exact default prelude;
- core literals and static scalar types, including adaptive exact `int`, fixed-width integer contracts, `float` with its explicit `float32`/`float64` widths, the grouped integer `.coerce` family, normative arithmetic/conversion failures, and target capability diagnostics;
- functions, required/optional parameters, positional/named arguments, calls, and return values;
- basic expressions, descriptor-object identity and `.type`, type-membership predicates, assignment, shifts, bitwise operators, and specified evaluation order; ordinary values remain identity-less and `===` is rejected;
- `if`/`else`, `while`, collection and three-clause `for`, `break`, `continue`, and `return`;
- grapheme-defined default string length with capability diagnostics, explicit string views, and the `trim`, `contains`, and `find` families;
- deterministic Rust lowering, a compiler-bundled integer support component usable offline, Cargo build/run, source maps, and diagnostics;
- abstract category descriptors and declared conformance, replacing enumerated category predicates;
- the general callable-family model: member families, bound methods, callable signatures, and typed member availability on one call-checking path;
- structured errors with `throw`/`try`/`catch`/`finally`, catchable core errors, and deterministic uncaught rendering;
- the named bounded-arithmetic families with their policy children and named result types;
- `bytes` as a real value type, explicit encoding objects, and typed decode failures;
- the iterator protocol with `iteration-step of Item`, and list, map, set, tuple, range, and entry under `/core/collections`;
- function values, closures, and storable bound method families;
- classes, single inheritance, structural interfaces, traits, `construct`, and deterministic drop;
- ownership: semantic value assignment, linear resources, non-owning `ref`, owning `shared ref`, explicit `move`, and the drop pipeline;
- orthogonal throwable and async callable contracts, with inferred suspension, receiver-mutation, concrete `unsafe rust`, and foreign-transition facts plus profile-governed reflection retention;
- async with `await`, task objects, the structured-concurrency scope, cooperative cancellation, and scope-propagated deadlines;
- byte and text stream protocols, process standard streams, files, paths, and race-resistant filesystem traversal;
- environment, arguments, the schema-driven CLI parser, and `exit-status`;
- date/time with monotonic timers, deadlines, and tickers;
- the document-value model with JSON, safe YAML, descriptor-driven mapping, and parsed URLs;
- secure and pseudo-random sources, hex and base64 codecs, digests and MACs, UUIDs, and bounded compression;
- networking addresses, DNS, TCP and UDP resources, and validated TLS;
- structured logging over profile sinks;
- direct Rust dependency declaration with a locked Cargo graph, the `reqwest::blocking` slice, and resolution-aware editor integration.

### Explicitly deferred

- source-declared generics and general pattern matching;
- multiple class inheritance and implicit signature overloading or multimethods;
- generators and `yield`;
- labels and `goto`;
- user-replaceable core structural constructs, including `function`;
- a truncating (C/Rust-style) signed integer division and remainder family alongside the specified default contract;
- variadics, if they delay the core pipeline;
- custom declaration modifiers and package-defined type constructors;
- custom importers and registries beyond the locked Cargo graph version one requires;
- C ABI export and foreign-runtime adapters, including Python;
- debugger integration, tracing, and profiling beyond the retained reflection metadata;
- stateful hot-code replacement and time-travel or replay;
- locale-policy-rich text APIs until deterministic policy objects are specified;
- `no_std`, embedded, firmware, and kernel compilation.

Items moved out of this list by the settled decisions — classes, interfaces, traits, ownership and `ref`/`move`, `throw`/`try`/`catch`/`finally`, float and string coercion destinations, closures, inline Rust with locked Rust dependencies, reflection, and async — are now required above and scheduled in milestones 7 through 27.

Deferral means “diagnose as unsupported,” not “leave behavior accidental.”

### Note on the deferred truncating-division family

Version one specifies exactly one signed division and remainder contract. A later version
may add an explicit truncating pair. It is deferred rather than rejected because the
compatibility case is real even though the performance case is weak.

Performance is not the justification, and this should not be reopened on intuition alone.
Signed division already costs tens of cycles, so the rounding correction is noise beside
it; where both operands are provably non-negative the two contracts agree and the
correction folds away entirely; and for a constant power-of-two divisor the specified
contract is the *cheaper* one, lowering to an arithmetic shift and a mask where truncation
needs sign correction before and after. Reopen this on a measured hot path.

Compatibility is the justification. Porting an algorithm whose reference implementation is
specified in C, Java, Go, or Rust semantics, or implementing a published spec that defines
truncation, otherwise forces a hand-written correction at every division site, which is
both noisy and easy to get wrong.

Constraints on any future design:

- name the operation for its rounding behavior, never for a backend. A "Rust division"
  spelling inherits an underspecified contract at signed minimum divided by `-1` and at a
  zero divisor, and stops being true the moment a second backend exists;
- ship the division and remainder together, because mixing rounding modes across the two
  breaks `quotient * divisor + remainder == dividend`;
- do not cross the rounding axis with the overflow-policy families. Offer truncation at the
  default failure policy only; `checked-truncating-divide` is where the naming scheme fails
  and the combination can be composed by hand;
- no capability gate is warranted. Truncation is well defined, not unsafe, so it belongs in
  the ordinary named-operation tier beside the other explicit families.

### Note on the `.coerce` object and its policy table

Milestone 4.5 establishes one compiler-owned `.coerce` family carrying `.checked`,
`.wrap`, and `.saturate` members, reached through ordinary receiver syntax:

```terrane
value.coerce; int8              # throwing default
value.coerce.checked; int8      # int8|none
value.coerce.wrap; int8
value.coerce.saturate; int8
```

Conversion and overflow policy are independent axes, so flat names make every later
policy-bearing operation family multiply the source surface. The canonical grouping
prevents that growth without pretending that the policies share a result shape.

`.coerce` is one canonical compiler-owned family, not a protocol each type implements
separately. **Which policies exist is a property of the source and destination pair, not
of the family.** Saturating an `int` into a `string` is meaningless because a string has
no range to clamp against, while saturating a `string` into an `int8` can be defined once
text parsing exists. Version one rejects `wrap` and `saturate` for an `int` destination
because the adaptive integer is unbounded. The general model is a table.

Consequences for the implementation:

- applicability is a lookup on `(source type, destination type, policy)` returning a
  result shape or a source-oriented rejection. Version one covers integer sources and
  destinations only; non-integer pairs remain deferred above;
- the check happens on the complete call, not member access, because the destination
  follows policy selection;
- rejections name both types and the policy rather than reporting an unknown member;
- `.coerce` and its policies resolve statically and erase. A bare family outside a call is
  rejected until bound-method values and closures are implemented;
- `.wrap` and `.saturate` are total, `.checked` is partial, and the bare form raises;
- arithmetic retains its distinct named overflow-policy surface because operator syntax is
  its default form; coercion has no operator spelling.

## 10. Work sequencing inside each milestone

For every language feature:

1. write at least one accepted and one plausible rejected source fixture;
2. add the smallest lexer/parser support needed;
3. add resolution and semantic rules with source diagnostics;
4. add lowering and a reviewed Rust golden where the output contract changes;
5. compile the generated crate;
6. run the source program when the feature has runtime behavior;
7. add the case to the permanent conformance suite;
8. update the implemented-feature manifest only after the end-to-end case passes.

A feature is not complete when it merely parses or emits plausible Rust.

## 11. Early design decisions that require prototype evidence

Resolve these through small conformance branches before their dependent milestones are frozen:

- the compiler-side representation of the object protocols the language draft requires in its section 9.6, especially member lookup and coercion: how the compiler answers what members a static type carries, with what contracts, availability conditions, and result shapes, so that member semantics stop being decided by name text independently at each use site. This underlies `.coerce` and its policy table, `.length` and the explicit string views, `.type` and identity, text display, truth, iteration, and equality, so it wants one model rather than one decision per operation;
- representation and implementation strategy for exact adaptive core `int`, including its arbitrary-precision support dependency and target-capability boundary;
- whether the selected collection subset needs facilities beyond the already-required integer support component;
- representation of finite dynamic alternatives in generated Rust;
- generated module boundaries for multiple namespaces in one package;
- source-map encoding between Terrane byte spans and generated Rust spans;
- manifest location and deterministic discovery for multi-unit projects.

Each decision should leave behind executable accepted/rejected cases. Do not use `demos/` to settle these questions because their surrounding unsupported constructs would confound the result.

## 12. Immediate implementation backlog

Milestones 0 through 4.9 are delivered. Milestone 4.9 adds destination-context constant
evaluation for typed bindings and assignments, parameter defaults, declared arguments, and
declared returns; exact integer folding uses unbounded intermediates while floating folding
uses destination precision. Typed numeric destinations now perform exact widening without a
failure path and checked conversion otherwise, including integer/floating crossings. Numeric
operand context, concrete integer promotion, floating rounding members, and constant-aware
`is a` membership share the same admissibility rules; unresolved membership descriptors now
fail at their source span.

Permanent conformance cases compile and run contextual return literals, grouped constant
arithmetic, exact fixed/adaptive/floating crossings, fractional conversion failure, rounding,
and admissible/inadmissible numeric membership. Reviewed goldens show bare fixed-width return
literals, direct contextual materialisation, unchecked widening, and explicit checked
conversion paths. Milestone 5 follows, with its boundary at Rust IR, readable deterministic
emission, and Cargo builds; later language features remain staged by their own milestones. The minimal
collection subset remains explicitly deferred: `/core/collections` is an empty reserved namespace
until iterator and collection support arrives in milestones 13 and 14.

Every item above is implementation; the only open questions are the naming and diagnostic surfaces milestone 4.9 defers to specification §40.9, and no semantics wait on them. The conversion boundary is settled: a declared numeric destination performs its own exact-or-throw conversion, `coerce` selects a policy other than that default and never takes options, the floating rounding members name their mode, `parse` always requires a callback and is typed by that callback's declared return, and base-N interpretation is the separate `radix` operation attached by receiver. Milestone 7 additionally delivers `parse` under its version-one restriction that the callback be a statically resolvable function name, and the `radix` pair.

## 13. Definition of done

The first-version compiler is done only when:

- its supported subset is explicit and executable;
- accepted programs are checked, lowered, compiled, and run through one pipeline;
- rejected programs fail at the correct Terrane spans with stable diagnostics;
- generated Rust and Cargo files are deterministic and readable;
- a nontrivial purpose-built CLI program builds from a clean installed compiler;
- tests cover parsing, semantics, lowering, Cargo integration, runtime behavior, and backend diagnostic projection;
- `examples/` contains only programs guaranteed to build;
- `demos/` remains clearly excluded from all support and conformance claims;
- unsupported draft features fail clearly rather than being silently miscompiled.
